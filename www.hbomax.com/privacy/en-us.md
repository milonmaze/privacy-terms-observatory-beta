HBO Max Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information HBO Max and WarnerMedia companies (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collect, use, share and otherwise process about individuals (“you”) interacting with us (“Information”) on our websites, applications (“apps”), services connected devices (e.g. connected TVs) and other offerings (“Offering” or “Offerings”).  

Our family of companies is made up of a number of different legal entities and business units. You can learn  more about our legal entities and business units by visiting our AFFILIATES PAGE. 

In this Privacy Policy, the Controller or Controllers  (“Controller”) of your Information means the company that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is processed. The company acting as Controller depends on which Offering you are using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that Offering, as may be set out in our terms of use. In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible for processing your Information, for example, where Information is shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy. Please navigate to our CONTROLLER LIST for more details. If you still have questions about the relevant Controller, please contact us using one of the methods set out below.

Under the laws of some countries outside the European Economic Area, we may need your consent to our processing of your Information set forth in this Privacy Policy. Subject to any indications you may give us to the contrary, such as opting out or not opting in if asked, and where permitted by law, by providing Information or otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. It explains the types of Information we may collect about you, the purposes for and methods by which we collect it, and (where applicable) the lawful basis on which we do so, as well as information about data retention, your rights and how to contact us. This Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data processing activities, including Information that we collect through our various Offerings such as those set out below: 

Digital Services:

Our websites, including activities run through our websites, such as surveys, research studies, focus group tests, promotions, competitions and prize-draws, purchases within our services, calls to action for user-generated content (“UGC”) and newsletters
Mobile apps, including activities run through our apps, such as those listed for our websites
Subscription or streaming services and services where you receive content through our websites, mobile apps and/or via a service provided by a third party, such as an internet service provider, pay TV platform or mobile phone operator
Console games
Our fan pages/channels/accounts on third party social networks 

Offline Services:

Studio tours
Attractions and exhibitions (e.g. theme parks, marketing activations at conventions or other public places, in person VR experiences) 
Events you attend as a consumer or guest (as opposed to in a business capacity) such as film premieres, marketing and influencer events, focus group or user tests and private events held at our premises or studios under hire

Please note that we may combine Information that we collect via one source (e.g. a website) with Information we collect via another source (e.g. a mobile app), such as an affiliate or a third party (as further described below). Please also note our Offline Services may involve you interacting with our Digital Services and vice-versa, for example, where you book a studio tour or event through one of our websites. Certain Offerings (for example, some branded theme parks, online stores, and in-app purchases) are not operated by us but by a third party licensee or the app store; any processing of your personal information by such a third party is not subject to this Privacy Policy, so please check whether the relevant terms of use refer to additional companies.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect, use, share and otherwise process the following categories of Information:

1)    Information we may collect from you:

Registration, account, and sign-up Information, including information about you when you register or sign up with us for one of our Offerings (e.g. name, username, password, email, contact details, date of birth or age, interest in our content, etc.)

This may also include demographic information, including at an individual or household level. In collecting Information about your use of a Digital Service, we may use service providers or other solutions to record users’ interactions with our Sites, which may include mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. We use these recordings  to diagnose issues and identify areas for improvement and further engagement.

If you grant permission, you may be able to take pictures or video within the app experience, to send them to us, or to access certain augmented reality (“AR”) or similar interactive features. Some of these features may rely on camera systems to track movements of your eyes and other facial features or your immediate surroundings to apply AR effects, filters, or other features.
Sensitive data you choose to share as part of our Offerings, or where you provide Information during one of our surveys, research or feedback sessions, including, where permitted by applicable law, Information relating to your physical or mental health, race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, or your political beliefs.

For information about how you can customize your privacy settings on Social Media Sites, and how those Social Media Sites handle your personal information and content, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies, and terms of use.
Information shared on the Offering or in public or community forums, including where you share photos, letters, videos or comments. On some Offerings, you may be able to interact with other users, including through text or chat features. Depending on your privacy settings, this Information or content and your username may become public on the Internet or within a community of users.

Information from other sources. On occasion, we combine Information with other online information we receive, including usage information about your interactions with other websites and with online advertising and media. We also supplement or combine Information with Information from a variety of other sources or outside records, including third-party data providers that provide us with Information such as demographics, transaction and purchase history, Information about the content and advertisements you interact with, or inferences about your demographics or preferences. We may receive Information from third parties with which you have a subscription agreement that includes access to our content or services, such as a cable or smart device provider.

Below, we explain our various purposes, any processing activities that we believe may need further explanation and, where necessary, the ‘lawful basis’ on which we rely to process your Information. 

Please note that while Information may be processed for more than one purpose (e.g., we may use Information collected to provide an Offering to analyze or market the Offering), not all of the purposes or processing activities below will necessarily apply in every case. Our particular use of your Information will depend on the Offering you engage with and the manner in which you interact with us, including the permissions you give us. Your ability to control some of the purposes for which your Information is processed is described in the INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS REQUEST and COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION sections below.

On our own or working with affiliates or third parties, we may:

Use cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDKs, or similar technologies to collect data and show advertisements on our Digital Services and on third party websites and applications over time; 
Use these same technologies for other reporting, measurement, and site analytics on our Digital Services and on third party websites and applications over time;
Get Information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other Information, including third party information, from across your devices and browsers and across websites, services, and apps over time, in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our Digital Services and across your devices and browsers (‘interest-based advertising’); and

Important things to note about cookie-based web browser opt-outs (such as those utilized by the EDAA, APDA, DAAC, and DAA):

Blocked cookies: The opt-out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Deleting or protecting opt-outs: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt-out cookies. 
Only this browser: The opt-out only applies to the browser in which you set it. For example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process. This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.
The opt-out does not block or delete cookies: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than interest-based advertising. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities (including for research, analytics, and internal operations) and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.

Choices for third party activities on mobile apps and devices.  To learn more about interest-based advertising on mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please visit the ADCHOICES.COM LINK to download the version of AppChoices for your device. For certain of our Digital Services, you can manage your preferences through our consent management platform. 

You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. Most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple devices and Android for Google and Samsung devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent use of Information to deliver personalized or interest-based advertising. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for your device’s operating system to learn more about these features and how to exercise your choices.

Choices for our targeted advertising activities. We also offer an opt-out from some of our own targeted advertising activities.  

To learn more and opt out of these targeted marketing activities on a web browser: visit HTTPS://WWW.WARNERMEDIAPRIVACY.COM/OPT-OUT.  
To opt out on a mobile or other connected device (e.g., gaming console or an app on a smart TV): use device settings as described above and we will honor opt-outs that we receive by limiting certain advertising activities on that device.

Please note that if you opt out:  

We will continue to collect data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. 
You may continue to receive advertising on our Digital Services, such as ads based on your activities on our Digital Services. 
Your opt-out choice will apply to the browser or device where you make the choice. 

Choices for precise location information. To limit  our mobile apps’ access to precise location information from your mobile device, you can:

        (1)    Respond ‘No’ to location permission prompts that are presented during your use of our app and/or 

        (2)    Restrict the relevant device settings.

Either of these actions will also prevent third parties from collecting precise location data through our apps and will prevent our use or sharing of such information for all purposes including advertising. You may also limit the collection of precise location information from websites through browser settings.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We operate internationally, and some of the processes involved in our use of your Information require your Information to be stored or processed in countries outside the country where you are located, including countries where the level of legal protection for your Information may be different and where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to it or without an adequate standard of data protection regulation in accordance with your local law. In particular, your Information may be transferred to, and processed in the United States, where some of our systems are located.  If and to extent that any consent, authorization or acknowledgement from you is required under any applicable law in your country or territory to enable the lawful transfer to any such country, including the United States, then, to the fullest extent permitted by any such applicable law, you hereby provide, and shall be deemed to have lawfully provided, on an unconditional and legally binding basis, all such consents, authorizations and acknowledgements.

Please see our AFFILIATES PAGE for examples of the countries where your Information may be transferred. 

However, whenever we transfer your Information outside of a country or region, such as the European Economic Area, we will make sure that we take steps necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements.

HBO MAX KIDS PROFILES

The HBO Max Platform is directed to adults only, and users must be over the age of 18 to sign-up. Please note that the word “Platform” in this section has the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.

Adult account holders can create a Kid Profile for each child in the household to use the Platform at their own discretion. We strongly recommend that the account holder set up Kid Profiles and make use of the custom parental controls for content. The account holder must comply with any applicable obligation, taking into account a minor’s rights under applicable law. 

We have different practices for the information we collect through the HBO Max Kids Profiles than we do for the other parts of our Platform, which are for adults. This section of the Privacy Policy applies to the information collected through Kid Profiles only.

What Information Do We Collect From Kid Profiles?

We collect only the following Information related to child users of the Kids Profiles

Profile set up information: When you set up a Kid Profile, we will ask the account holder to provide the child’s first name (or any other name for that profile that you may choose), and, if you decide to upload one, a profile photo or avatar chosen by you.
Parental control preferences:  You can exercise parental controls over your child’s use of the profile, like the kinds of shows and movies they can watch and how to require a PIN to switch between the profiles on your HBO Max account.
Technical and usage information: When a child user visits or uses the Kid Profile, we will get some information about their device and their internet browser (for example, Safari, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about their IP Address, device identifiers, content searched, viewed, and added to a watchlist, and generally how they use the Kid Profile of our Platform.
When users contact us: If your child contacts us by email or using an online form, we will ask them for some information. For example, this may include their first name and email address and the reason they are contacting us. We will not use this contact information for any other purpose. Once we have completed their request, we will delete their information.
