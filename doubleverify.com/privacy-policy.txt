1. INTRODUCTION

This DoubleVerify Privacy Notice (the “Privacy Notice”) informs customers, consumers and partners (“you” and “your”) on DoubleVerify’s use, collection, and sharing of your personal information in connection with our services. This Privacy Notice will help to explain your privacy rights in relation to these activities. As used in this Privacy Notice, “Personal Information” means information that relates to an identified individual or to an identifiable individual.

DoubleVerify, Inc. (“DoubleVerify”) is the industry leader in providing transparency and accountability in online advertising. This Privacy Notice describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the DoubleVerify Services. Our accredited technology platform provides an independent, third-party set of measurements about ad impression delivery and website traffic to help advertisers and advertising inventory sellers confirm accurate delivery characteristics, including brand safety, viewability metrics, contextual and environmental parameters (e.g., the website on which an ad appears, and where it appears on the webpage) and ad impression and website traffic quality characteristics, as well as to help ensure that advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements. Additionally, advertisers use information we provide about ad impression opportunities to decide if they want their creative displayed in the available impression environment. DoubleVerify collects this data about advertising delivery and website traffic on behalf of both advertisers and sellers and shares the information we collect to drive transparency and accountability in the online advertising marketplace.

DoubleVerify uses various technologies to collect information about online advertising, website traffic, mobile app traffic, and connected device traffic in order to deliver advertising transparency and accountability services to our customers (collectively, “DoubleVerify Services”).

2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to inform you of: (1) the types of information DoubleVerify may gather about you or your device when an advertisement that is analyzed by us is delivered to you on a website you are viewing or in an app you are using, and (2) how we may use, share, and otherwise process that information.

DoubleVerify does not collect, retain or share any personally identifiable information gathered on sites or apps not owned by DoubleVerify. This includes both unique user identifiers, as well as IP addresses, except for the limited purpose of fraud prevention, geo compliance and never to create user profiles in which case we collect and retain, but do not share user IP addresses for 45 days and never correlate a user IP addresses across domains except when fraud is detected.

3. WHICH CATEGORIES OF DATA AND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?

DoubleVerify Services do not collect and use personal information that may directly or indirectly identify you, except for providing fraud prevention services and for geography compliance services. When collecting personally identifiable information for fraud prevention and for geography compliance, the data will be used only for these purposes and will never be used for other purposes or services, unless required by law.

Categories of data and personal information collected by the DoubleVerify Services:
No identifiable information is collected for provisioning the services in this section (including IP addresses, device identifiers, cookies and user identifiers).
The non-identifiable categories of data collected by DoubleVerify for the services in this section are always used either in an aggregate manner or separately from any of your identifiable information. None of the below attributes are ever tied back to any personally identifiable information and are never used to identify you or other users across websites or over time:
Advertising campaign attributes – The identifier of the advertiser that delivers an ad, its campaign and placement identifiers, its ad-servers identifiers and the identifiers of the media property selling the inventory to the advertiser are collected and processed to identify the customer we are servicing, to apply the correct settings for the customer, to segment the customer and partners reports according to these identifiers and to bill the customer.
Web content attributes – The web address (URL) of the page/frame where the ad is being delivered to, and the address of any referring pages/frames are collected to ensure the ads are delivered in the right context our customer has set in the profile settings in our system.
Mobile application attributes – The mobile application name, mobile application id, app store, developer of the application, star ratings of the application, age rating of the application and other publicly available information about the mobile application where the advertisement is delivered to. This information is used to ensure the advertisements are delivered in the right context our customer has set in the profile settings in our system.
Digital environment attributes – The type of connected device the advertisement is being delivered to: mobile, desktop, connected TV or other device, the browser type and version used to render the page where the ad appears and the operating system are collected to determine what version of our code would properly run in that environment and to properly measure if the advertisement had the chance to become viewable on the screen according to industry standards which vary between environments.
Viewability attributes – The location of the ad on the page, the size of the ad, the size of the screen, the size of the viewport, the tab focus status, the browser focus status, the time duration the ad was in the viewable part of the webpage and the scroll position of the webpage are collected to determine and report to our customers if the advertisement had the chance to become viewable on the screen.
Exposure and engagement attributes – Data that shows if the ad was clicked, resized, skipped, muted, paused, rotated, hovered or changed volume is collected to help our customers measure the performance of the advertisement, the advertising campaign or the media property. The data is not tied back to any personally identifiable information.
Categories of data and personal information collected by the DoubleVerify Services solely for fraud prevention and geo compliance purposes:
Device identifiers and attributes – IP address, user agent, advertising ID, and user ID, in order to analyze whether the device is participating in a fraudulent scheme.
IP addresses are collected to extract geolocation information. Exact geolocation information is never collected about you. The geolocation is reported back to our customers without the underlying IP address or any other personally identifiable information.
The information described in section 3.1 above is also used to analyze anomalies for fraud detection purposes.
Categories of data and personal information collected by DoubleVerify for business purposes:This section outlines data collected through DoubleVerify’s sales, marketing and operations activity and not as part of the DoubleVerify Services. For avoidance of doubt, the DoubleVerify measurement tag, pixel, SDK, or any other technology of the DoubleVerify Services do not collect the information described in this section, unless disclosed in Section 3.1 or 3.2 above:
Personal identifiers and business contact details including first and last name, email address, telephone, business address, position and title. This information is used in order to communicate with our customers, prospects and leads for sales, marketing and service activity.
Online identifiers from pixels and cookies placed on this website are used for marketing activities (see Section 11).
Inferences drawn from the above information.

Preemptive decisioning of impression opportunities. DoubleVerify technology analyzes the data characteristics of an impression opportunity and determines whether the customer’s advertisement should be displayed or not.
In working with our partners we may anonymously integrate advertising impression data with data our partners independently collect to deliver enhanced ad-measurement services such as augmented and aggregated audience demographic reporting of campaign impressions viewed or brand lift metrics.
