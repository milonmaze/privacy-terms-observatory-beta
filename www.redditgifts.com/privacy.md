What are everyone’s unpopular opinions?

I’ll go first

Act 2 is my least favourite and act 3 is my favourite.

Jaheira is a much better companion/Druid than Halcin (who is kind of useless overall).

Raphael isn’t hot and/or f*ckable. He’s actually quite annoying.

Edit: of all the answers here, the ones that surprised me the most were the Karlach dislike/hate.

what movie jerks actually had a point?

here are a few examples.

harry from night of the living dead. him being a colossal asshole doesn't stop him from being absolutely right that hiding out in the basement would have increased the group's chances of survival.

clubber lang from rocky 3. sure, he's an arrogant loudmouth who can't even breathe without being disrespectful but he did absolutely win the championship fair and square.

fletcher from whiplash. he may be an extremely verbally abusive asshole but he is right that some people need to be pushed beyond their capabilities to be able to achieve greatness.

mr potter from it's a wonderful life. while he is easily one of the most morally bankrupt characters in all of cinema(to the point where there's even a popular fan theory that he's supposed to represent the devil while george is meant to represent jesus), he is correct that george's father, as nice of a guy as he was, wasn't very business savvy. even george admits that he has a point.

eric matthews from saw 2. he is a dirty cop but he is absolutely right that john kramer, no matter how much he tries to justify his actions, is still a murderer. as he accurately puts it "putting a gun to someone's head and forcing them to pull the trigger is still murder".

AITAH for wanting a divorce after cancer

Sorry this is gonna be long.

I (35f) and my husband (36m) have been married for 8 years, together for 11. We’ve got two kids (6 and 8). Last year I was diagnosed with cancer. Although the treatment was brutal, I pulled through, or so it seems for now. The truth is, things have not been smooth for the past 5 years or so. I have been trying to fit in what my husband sees as ideal life, living in remote locations and adjusting my life to make it work for us as a family. His dream is to live by the ocean, far from people. I’m a city girl. For the sake of making it work for both of us, I’ve taken jobs that are well below my abilities. For him though it does look like it’s what I wanted. It was, because at that point it was the only available thing given the compromise. My husband was living his dream life not even realizing that my resentment was building up. I did bring this up many times but he was dismissive. Things blew up two times - he saw me flirting with another guys (I never even kissed anyone, but it was an emotional betrayal probably). I gave up alcohol 3 years ago to make sure I’m always in control and don’t do stupid shit that can ruin my relationship.

My husband is a great father. I’ve never had a father like that. He loves our children and they have a great relationship. So do I with my kids. But he isn’t a great partner. He asks me every day about my day, but never really listens to what I say. He keeps talking about his work but doesn’t notice me.

He makes a lot more than me (7-10x), but insists that we pay everything 50/50 “to keep it fair”. During the past years I’ve been covering more expenses that him, and I was working full-time during my treatment. He never offered to pay for any extras. In his book, there were years (my pregnancies) when I was paying less, so now it’s fair that I pay more.

I don’t feel emotionally connected to him at all. And I don’t want to have sex with him. I have a history of abuse and I need an emotional connection to enjoy sex. But for the past 5 years he’s been only touching me if and when he needs sex. I’ve given in so many times and cried after because it felt like I’ve betrayed myself but I had to do it because he needs it and I’m a spouse.

So now, I’ve been still contemplating divorce for over 8 months. I’m out of treatment and I don’t know if I’m gonna stay healthy for a long time. But I’m tired of compromises. He is a nice guy and we’re planning to start a therapy, but I just want to live a new life. Therapy seems like a burden to me.

AITA for wanting a divorce?
