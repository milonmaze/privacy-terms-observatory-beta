AITA for not letting my sister in law hold our baby?
Not the A-hole

My wife and I just brought home our beautiful baby. When we got home, I wanted my older son to hold the baby (he is fourteen), but my wife said no. She said she wasn't comfortable with anyone but us holding the baby yet. I wasn't happy about this, but I respect that, as a mom, she's anxious about how vulnerable our baby is. So I let it go.

Yesterday her sister came over and wanted to hold the baby. I said no, that my wife and I aren't comfortable with anyone but us holding him yet. My wife then said it was fine, that her sister was a special case. I said no, that I wasn't comfortable with it. Her sister was offended and left.

My wife is angry with me and says I was an asshole to her sister. I think I am just being consistent. Was I an asshole to my sister in law?
