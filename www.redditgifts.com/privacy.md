Serious question: for those of you who are happily married or happily dating, what's the main reason you don't cheat on your partner?

Imagine you're at a bar by yourself and see someone you consider attractive. What's stopping you from going over and making come-ons to them and going back to their place?

I'm not trying to justify cheating, I promise. I'm just trying to understand what it's like to love someone as much as you love your partner and understand why you would never give in to those desires with a stranger.
