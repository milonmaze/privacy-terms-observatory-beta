Amazon has turned in to Ali Express

Has anyone else noticed that amazon is selling absolute garbage items.

My wife and I have a 3 month old and I bought an electric nail file, it was only a tenner but it had 1500 reviews and had a rating of 4.7 out of 5

Came today and it was made of the cheapest plastic and to be honest I expected that. But you can't even put the batteries in the back and put the back piece on without it popping the batteries back out so your only option is to use it without the backplate

Ordered a powerbank two weeks ago that was supposed to be 30k mha and it charged my phone once and it went from 100% to 50%

And I suspect amazon know this, all their return options are shit as well. Printer required for every option and their customer service recommended alternative is to send it back at my expense and they refused to reimburse me!

Fuck Amazon!
