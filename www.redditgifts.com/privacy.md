My husband is 40 and has been in university for 20 years. Would that be a red flag for you?

He gets paid to go to school, about USD$40,000 a year equivalent. The university offers a bursary for aboriginal students, and he's been the only applicant in some time. He gets it every year. But he also gets age based grants and bursaries, none of it needs to be paid back. He describes himself as a career student because he loves being in school. It's all above board, the university even encourages it.

He has degrees in linguistics, history, chemistry, computer science, accounting, and is currently working on a physics degree. He loves to learn and to teach others; he's the smartest person I know. He says he stays in school because it's his "hobby" and he's paid a pretty penny for it. We're completely debt free.

I think our relationship is unique in that I have no problem with it, although I'd like to see him apply himself outside a school setting. But I want to know what other people think of it. It's not something I generally tell my friends, just that he's in school part time and doing other things. His 10~ hour commitment a week puts food on our table; we don't live in luxury but live comfortably.

Former rich people of reddit, what is a luxury item/product you used to buy regularly that you could no longer afford and found the out a generic/ consumer brand was exactly the same?

Did you realized later it was a cash grab all along?

On the flip side what is a luxury product/ item you wish you could still afford but canâ€™t and is worth every penny? Why?
