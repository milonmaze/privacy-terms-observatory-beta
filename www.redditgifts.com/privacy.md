AITAH for leaving my own wedding because my husband embarrassed me?

I F27 and my husband M29 have been together for 3 years. In those 3 years I have never have known him to be selfish, occasionally immature yes, but even that was rare.

These problems arose when those stupid cake smashing videos got popular and my husband thought they were hilarious. I've never thought they were funny and he knows that, yet he was always showing me the videos of those poor wives getting the happiest day of their life ruined by their asshole partner for some cheap laughs. He also knows I have a history with cake smashing.

My family does the cake smashing thing. I remember it was my 17th birthday and I pleaded with my mom to not do it. She promised and I trusted her. I had my hair and makeup done up all nice and right as I blew out my candles my mom pushed my head into the cake and one of the decorations on the cake ended up slicing my forehead. Not enough to go to the hospital but enough for some substantial bleeding. My birthday was ruined and after I wouldn't come out my room. My mom still calls me a brat for that.

I told him if he ever did something like that to me I'd leave him. He started laughing but I was being for real. Though he really was not taking me seriously.

Now skip to a few days ago when my wedding happened. Everything was perfect, I was happy, he was happy. I was excited for our new lives as newlyweds. I felt like a princess in my poofy white dress and done up hair with perfect make-up. All very expensive things I would like to mention.

We get to the cake cutting part and as I turn to him he scoops up a huge chunk of our wedding cake and smashes it all over my face. Everything just seemed to go in slow motion for a few moments. He's just laughing at me, and then says "you should see your face" and continues to laugh. Other people in the crowd (mostly my family) is also laughing at me.

Then I just start walking away, he realizes that I'm leaving and tries to catch up with me and says I'm being extra. I push him away and order an uber. As I got outside most of the crowd is following me telling me to come back. I get into the uber and drive away.

I drove to our apartment and packed most of my things and went to stay at a hotel. I currently though am staying at a friend's house. My family and his family has been blowing up my phone for days. Saying I'm being childish and my husband is a good man and it was just a joke.

My husband has been calling me off the hook telling me to please come home and that he wants to talk. That he's sorry and didn't think I'd get that "emotional".

This was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives and he embarrassed me in front of everyone for some prank that he knew I hated.

Not only that, he ruined a 500 dollar cake. He ruined my makeup, my hair and the top of my dress. The cake got all over. Though I still do love him and I'm wondering If I really was to hard on him, that seems to be everyone else's opinion.

Update: I decided to speak to him bright and early this morning. I'm leaving him. Some of you might be happy about that and some of you might not be.

I decided to call him and get his reasoning for why he did what he did.

He told me he just thought it was a funny prank and that if it was at the wedding on a happy day that he could change my mind. Plus since it was a tradition in my family that I wasn't following, he thought that he could get points with my family. Then told me he's sorry that I took it as a disrespect.

I told him he shouldn't be saying that "he's sorry that I took it that way". He should be apologizing for hurting me. Where is the "I'm sorry". I told him he hasn't apologized with accountability once. All his "apologies" have been back handed.

I also reminded him that I didn't have a good relationship with most of my family nor my mother who he forced me to invite. I told him he knew I was already the black sheep of my family and the verbal abuse and public humiliation I received by my mother for years really messed with me and he knew that.

Then he says this.

"Why should I have to apologize because you can't take a joke"

I blew up, I told him "are you serious, if it was me who hurt you to this degree the first thing I'd do is apologize, while you can't even force yourself to be decent for a few secs and just apologize to me." I also told him that he was trying to get in good with a family who abused me by public humiliating me and that is something that is unforgivable. Marriage means you stick by me, yet you showed you obviously do not. It's not about you ruining my dress or my hair or even the cake, it's about how you KNEW how I felt about this and the trauma I had connected and you didn't care.

He then tried doubling down and saying it wasn't his fault for not apologizing because my family was telling him how dramatic I was and how I was hurting them by leaving the wedding for a joke. He said he loves me and he doesn't want to break up over this nonsense and that I should just come home.

I told him I wasn't coming home and it wasn't even about the cake anymore, it's because I cannot be with a man who won't apologize when he's wrong and who gaslights their significant other into receiving the blame.

He started cursing me out at this point but after about a minute of hearing him scream at me I hung up.

I guess he started telling my family because within a half an hour my phone was blowing up again. The worst ones had to be from my mother and his sister.

My mother was telling me I am going to end up alone because I can't take jokes and I'll never be able to keep a man with my attitude. Even saying that my clock is running out fast and when it did no one will want me and I'll be alone.

His sister was telling me that I'm a disgusting b-word for hurting his brother and wasting his time. That she wishes that he would have broken up with me 2 years ago when he first wanted to.

So ig now I know he wanted to break up with me.

What I also know is that he was cheating on me for 6 months with his ex who wanted him back but then she dropped him because he stayed with me.

The thing is, I had a good relationship with his sister and she knew he was cheating on me??? I guess she put everything out on the table since I was leaving anyway.

I blocked most of my family and I blocked all of his family. I also blocked him and I'm getting the annulment.

My friend said I could stay with her for a few months till I get back on my feet. I told her I really appreciate it.

So yeah that's the end, I'm crying while typing this. I wasted 3 years on a man who never really cared about me. I've lost what little relationship I had with my family and now I only have the few friends I have been blessed with. I'm going to have to pick up the rest of my stuff.

I also told him before I blocked him, if he broke anything of mine I would bring it to court.

Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. I'm gonna go to sleep now since I haven't done so in 24 hours.

Im worried about men’s mental health. Men, who do you confide in 100%?

This week there was apost about lies men are told about women, and one of the comments said that women don’t care about men’s feelings. Im a woman, but that aside, who in your life do you open up to 100%? Dad, brother, friend?

EDIT: I did NOT expect to get this many responses but im really happy that it got a large discussion going. I think this topic is very important and extremely undervalued by our society. I AM young and naive, but thanks to your answers I feel I understand a man’s world a bit better now.

As a woman who genuinely cares about men’s mental health, and would love for my partner/ male friends to be able to lean on me…this discussion has shown me that i belong in a small minority. That most women don’t want to see men as fallible humans with vulnerable emotions. This angers me as much as it saddens me and I see now that this is a HUGE problem within interpersonal relationships. We as women need to do better in this department!!!!!. Now i ask myself the question, “where do men get their strength from?”
