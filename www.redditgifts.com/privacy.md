Do you pee in the shower?

I'm a male. Somehow the topic came up, and I told a female friend that I have peed in the shower. I thought that everyone did this. She was grossed out and said she has never done this. I told her it's likely 99 out of a hundred people have probably peed in the shower and she said I'm nuts. We joked that reddit will have the answer for us.

So, am I gross or is she too conservative?
