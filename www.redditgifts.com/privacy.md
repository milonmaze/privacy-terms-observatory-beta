AITAH for telling my bf that I don’t want his daughters in my apartment?

Throwaway.

I’m in a dilemma here because I know that people would think I’m callous but I don’t think I am. Give me your honest opinion.

I (f38) met my bf (m36) at a party 4 years ago and we hit it off immediately. I told him very early on that I’m child free because I know this is a turn off for many men and I don’t want to lead anybody on.

After a month he told me that he had two children. 11 and 12 (now). I freaked out because I didn’t know what to do. I liked him very much but I didn’t want to be a parental figure. He said I didn’t have to. He has shared custody with his ex and me and him would meet the weeks he doesn’t have custody. Now he basically lives in my place the weeks his daughters are with their mother. We said we loved each other very early on and we decided that this arrangement worked for us and to break up the moment it didn’t work anymore.

I could see myself with him forever. I love him to bits. I love our life together. I love missing him when he’s with his family. He proposed to me a month ago and I didn’t know what he meant but he said that we didn’t need to get married he just wanted me to have a ring. I thought it was romantic. Anyway a week later, he took his girls to my place for a weekend. His ex was sick and he didn’t want the girls to get infected. I asked him if he maybe wanted to be with his daughters instead but he said that he would miss me since its “our” week. I said ok. I have met his girls on many occasions and they’re lovely so I had no problems more than I felt a bit awkward.

Last week I got home and he had dropped his girls in my apartment. They were in my closet trying on my heels and clothes. I was freaking out so I called him. He said yeah, changed of plans. He and his ex switched so the girls are staying with us. When he got home I told him I couldn’t do this. If he was having problems with our arrangement then I understand but I still don’t want children in my place. He called me ah because his girls have done nothing and are polite etc. He loved me and we are engaged. Did I expect us to have two separate lives when we’ve been together for 4 years and love each other?

I’m tired of men thinking I don’t really mean it when I say I don’t want children. I love him and I do want to be with him and I see our future when his girls are old and left the home and we could live together and even get married. But I don’t think I’m being an AH. Yes our way maybe not traditional but my love for him is not lesser for it.

What would you name a newborn child if you really, really wanted to ruin their life, but wanted to maintain plausible deniability about having done it on purpose?

AITA for not wanting my autistic cousin at my child-free wedding?

Throwaway because I have family that use Reddit as well. Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don’t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call “high-functioning”, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don’t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it’s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I’ve met before, but I really don’t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn’t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an “adult”, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she’d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn’t want to hear it. My fiancé says I’m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn’t act like one. AITA?
