Heath Ledger's casting as Joker was famously doubted. Similarly, RDJ as Stark, Willis in Die Hard, Craig as Bond, JLaw as Katniss, etc. Are there examples of high-profile dubious casting choices where the critics were RIGHT?
Discussion

More examples include Adam Sandler in anything serious, Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher, Kristen Stewart as Diana, Pattinson as Batman, and the list goes on!

What were the ones that critics said just wouldn't work ... and they were right?

Only one that immediately comes to mind is Emma Stone in Aloha and MAYBE ScarJo in Ghost in the Shell (I enjoyed it!)

NOTE: This is not Who was a bad actor in a big role? This is Who did critics correctly predict would not fit the part?
