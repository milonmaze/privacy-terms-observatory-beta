Officially deleted my account.

I ordered a late night dinner around 1am. The instructions are to leave it at my door. I’ve never had issues with this before. But the driver decided to knock repeatedly on my door, which at first I just assumed they were new or unaware of the instructions. I however decided to not open my door and told him to leave it. He would not leave. I watched him set my food down pretend to walk down the hall and then slowly started walking back to my door. He then picked my food up and moved it further away so I couldn’t view it in the peephole. Then stood outside my door and continued this for over 15 minutes. I finally got on a very loud phone call saying “okay you’re here? see you soon!” and he took off. The entire situation felt very unsafe. A reminder to all. Never. Open. Your. Door.

EDIT: Before canceling my subscription and deleting my account I made sure to file a report on the driver.

I also should mention that the driver would not respond to the messages on the app asking him to leave the food but I clearly could see he was on his phone which I found concerning.

Being a teenager in the 90's was fucking amazing.

The music, the clothes, the TV, no phones, no internet, yet still feeling like you were living in the advanced future. I miss it.
