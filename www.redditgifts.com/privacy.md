My boyfriend 24m says that he doesn't want me 23f to initiate sex anymore as he feels emasculated.

Hey guys. So my boyfriend Duke and I have been dating for 4 months. Our first date was a blind date set up by our friends and I wasn't exactly into him at first. One of my pet peeves is when people chew with their mouth wide open and that's what he did, while talking too. I was annoyed but I stayed because he is very attractive and and has a great sense of humor. Both are some of the key attributes that I look for in a partner. I was still hesitant to go out on a second date, but my friend managed to persuade me. On the second date, I told him that his open mouth chewing bothers me and he right away stopped and never chewed with his mouth open again. A man that listens. Amazing, right?

Anyway, we had sex for the first time on the 5th date. It was a-ma-zing. I don't think the details are relevant here so I'll skip past that. After that, sometimes he'll initiate sex and sometimes I will. We both talked about our boundaries and agreed to do things that were comfortable for the both of us. He actually liked it when I initiated sex, which is supposed to be normal right? Or I guess it seemed like it because last night when we were watching a movie and I started rubbing his dick area he grabbed my wrist and said "We only have sex when I start it". Naturally I was like wtf are you talking about....

He then said that he never liked it when I initiate naughty time and that it makes himself feel emasculated. I was still confused so he continued with "Basically, men are the dominant alpha by birth so I don't like it when a woman is in control. I need to be the only one who initiates sex otherwise I will feel weak and pathetic". (Not his exact words but very close)

I told him that I never heard of any man complaining that it's weak to be hit on by a woman or for a woman to initiate sex and he said that it's because I'm young and still have a lot to learn which is exactly why he should be the alpha?

What the hell does that even mean? I still haven't broken up with him and we did have sex that night, "initiated" by him but since this morning I've been trying to make sense of what he said to no avail. I've asked my friends and they're also confused.

So this is why I've turned to Reddit for some advice. What did he mean by it?

What’s the most extreme example of someone getting your age wrong?

When I was 22, an adult asked me if I was 49.

Going the other way, when I was 27, an adult asked me if I was 17.
