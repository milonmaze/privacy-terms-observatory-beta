AITA for telling my wife to go and see her son before he dies?

My wife Sara (39f) has a son Vicky (20m) from her previous marriage. Because of the way my wife and I got together, there was a lot of strife in her divorce from her ex, there was a lot of tumult in Vicky's life and he was only eight at the time. For a few years, my wife tried her best and tried everything to help him but it was like the more she tried, the further away he got. It came to a head when he was twelve and she caught him trying to smoke and then he almost broke her jaw when she stopped him. After that, she stopped trying to force the custody and just let him stay with his dad.

When he was fourteen and we had our son, she sent him a message that his brother was born and that even if he doesn't want to be around her, it doesn't mean he can't love his brother. He just responded back with "Go **** yourself". She tried the same thing three years later when our daughter was born but got no response this time.

Well, two days ago she got a call from her ex and he was crying and apparently Vicky is dying. He has cancer and they found it very, very late and he's optimistically only got a month left and he's been begging to see her. So, I've told my wife to go and spend the month with him. She can work online from a month or take a leave or just quit if they don't understand. However, she's refused and she's used everything from work to needing to take care of our kids to even 'what if it's just a trick to hurt me more' as excuses to not go. At the same time, she keeps crying, muttering about thinking she had more time, ignoring our kids, looking at old photo albums of her and Vicky.

It came to a head this morning when I caught her having a breakdown in her car before going to work. I begged her to reconsider when I saw and she called me a ****ing ***hole for trying to push her into going. I know he's not my son and that I have no right over him but not going is tearing Sara apart, so AITAH?

Edit:

To everyone confused, when our kids were born are not the only two times that my wife tried to reach out and ask if he was ready to see her. It's just when our son was born was the only time that he responded. She tried up until his graduation when even his father tried to get him to invite her. She sent him money, presents and everything for his birthdays.

And as for when he struck her when he was twelve, he did so with a hockey stick and then kicked her when she fell. She forgave him for that because she knew what he was going through and he's her child but she decided to stop seeing him then because she didn't want her presence in his life to make him more violent. What if he hit another kid like that was her thought.

And to everyone saying therapy. Yes, she took him to therapy, she tried so much but he was non-responsive then.

Why is it popular to shit on men who struggle to date?

If you spend any time on the internet you'll run into a comment that goes somewhere along the lines of.

"I just struggle to date, women just don't seem to be interested in me".

And someone will comment "ooh look who's telling on himself"

Are we still in middle school where if you can't get a girlfriend you're a laughing stock? Lots of dudes have trouble dating, ranging from social anxiety, to being on the autism spectrum, to being very narrow in their field on interests and unable to relate well to women.

Why shit on people who are struggling or have other issues?

AITA for leaving my sons share of my estate to his daughter? My other kids don‚Äôt think I am being fair.

My spineless son Richard (38m) has prioritized his wife and step kids over his own daughter Haley (18f). It‚Äôs happened multiple times I have decided to disinherit him and rescind his stepkids 529 college funds. I am not here for judgment if I should disinherit him or rescinding the college funds but if it's fair to my other 2 kids by leaving my granddaughter an equal share of my estate. The way my will is currently written my estate will be split equally 3 ways. I have set up 529 funds for all my grandchildren which I am the sole owner of and that is all I planned for them to receive with the exception of family heirlooms. I'm seeing my lawyer Friday to make the change. My other 2 kids (41m & 36f) says its not fair to their kids.

Everyone agrees that Richard, his wife and stepkids are disowned and out of the family. Richard is extremely upset but you reap what you sow. He is certainly not going to leave anything to Haley now. My other 2 kids have substantial assets themselves and will be leaving their assets to their children. I don't understand with this being the case why Haley should not get her fathers portion. They think I should leave his share to all the grandkids equally. I am not so convinced. AITA?
