Why are some americans so angry about Joe Biden canceling billions of student debt loans?

Like right, left, centrist whatever you are, why would you be mad about this unless you are outright evil person? They take tax money off of you regardless and spend it on stuff you have no idea. I'm not american so idk what I am missing

Why would you be angry that your kids, relatives and basically future generations being free from lifelong debt? Is it just "i had to do it so they should do too" mentality? If so, do they know what inflation is and how economy doesn't stay the same for decades?

Edit: If you are unsatisfied because you know this fixes nothing and education still will be expensive and they need to fix that rather than just forgiving debts, I would agree but that seems a lot difficult tbf. Well.. it seems only difficult for America at least.

edit : For those of you who asked for my build/pob , here is my pride, my tank ts deadeye

For those who asked about how i made the currency, ill say the biggest thing was consistency.

I make currency trading, crafting and farming. At league start i crafted more, coz the market was more active and made several bows ranging from 20d to 120 divine ones.

As for farming my late game strategy was mostly farming crimson temple ( dropped 3 aphotecarys), farming essences with awakened sextanta and map device, heist caches with awakened sextant and alvas temples with awakened sextant, all with searing exarch influence and the ocassional delirium reward. quality the maps to 20, alch and go. The idea was to run maps fast and then sell temples, essences, deli orbs and heist stuff in bulk in tft. Was making north of 30 divines a day easily without counting lucky drops or bubblegum currency. Temples sell really well this league. I upgraded all my essences to defeaning before selling and harvest reroll the cheap ones. Didnt use scarab or real juice all league. Hope this helps.

Does anyone else think the whole "hate everything about California" thing is getting out of hand?

Does anyone else think the whole "hate everything about California" thing is getting out of hand? I refuse to hate an entire state of 38 million people because it seems to be the "cool thing" to do.

I am a native Texan and am getting tired of people just blindly hating everything about California and trash talking it. People have been moving to Texas from all over the country -- some of the top states sending people here are actually from red states like Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Florida -- yet you don't see many conservatives trash talking them for sending people here. Also while yes by sheer numbers we have received more Californian transplants, you also have to take into consideration that it is by far the most populous state so per capita the numbers aren't as disproportional. I also read that ~40,000 Texans move to California each year so they get their fair share of our people as well.

I recently went on vacation to Southern California and actually really enjoyed it there. So many people in Texas (mostly conservatives) who have never even been there, have told me that California is some post-apocalyptic hell hole.. but I found it to be incredibly beautiful in most parts and never felt unsafe in all the areas I visited. I found the infrastructure was in better condition overall than here in Texas, even the poor areas of the city looked cleaner/better maintained than our blighted neighborhoods and poor rural areas. The beach towns there (of which there are countless of) were just stunning and full of people everywhere just enjoying life and the beautiful scenery -- spending all day at the beach surfing, playing volleyball, hanging out with friends/family etc.

I just find it unwarranted that Californians are blamed for everything when it seems like I am starting to see more Florida and Louisiana license plates around lately. In California, most people either have no opinion on Texas (i.e. they don't even think about us) or just say "it isn't their cup of tea"/don't like the politics here. It seems sort of one-sided the hate that so many Texans have towards Californians, it's honestly starting to feel kind of insecure and pathetic.
