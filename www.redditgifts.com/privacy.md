IAmA Person Who Woke Up After Spending Six Months in a Coma. AMA!
Unique Experience

Hello Reddit! One day in 2015 I woke up thinking it was time to go to work, but for some reason, found myself strapped to a bed in the hospital. When I met eyes with the attending nurse and asked if I could use the bathroom, she teared up and ran out of the room -- only to come back a few minutes later to apologize and explained that for the past six months I had been in a coma due to a very severe traumatic brain injury. The neurologist said if I did eventually wake up, I wouldn’t be able to do much of anything. You can read the full story in great detail over at MEL Magazine, and be sure to visit the subreddit r/TBI, a community of support, awareness, and information about traumatic brain injuries.

I'm here to answer any questions you have about waking up from a coma, traumatic brain injuries, and any other questions you might have. AMA!
