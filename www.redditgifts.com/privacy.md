AITA for thinking my wife overrated when an elderly lady touched our kid?

Hey reddit I need a tie breaker vote here our family and friends are divided here.

My wife and I went shopping, I went to a different isle to get some jerky. I heard my wife scream HELP! So I ran over, and she was freaking out because an elderly women hugged our son, you can tell the women was harmless. The women's son came along and profusely stating that she had dementia and she meant no harm, that she tends to view every child as her child.

I said it was okay, and I myself apologized for my wife's overreaction. During this time I was not paying attention and my wife called 911, and called over security it became a huge mess for all parties because my wife was not letting the issue go. You could also tell the son was extremely embarrassed as was I. I was trying to relax my wife, but she was going on a complete meltdown rage saying that his mother should be in a home if she cannot keep her hands to herself. What if she got our kid sick, tried to kidnap him, got combative and hurt him.

All of which I agree are possible outcomes, but I told her none of that happened so let's just leave it. Security states since the wife called the police we had to wait for them to show up, so they can file a report as per their store policy. About 25 minutes later police showed up and asked what happened and my wife explained everything, you can tell the police where like WTF is wrong with this women. I felt nothing but disappointment. Police took the statement and started laughing as they left. Gave the son of the elderly mom a fist bump and said sorry.

My wife was upset I did not have her side, she was upset how I took the side of the son instead of her. I explained his mom was clearly sick, it was a harmless gesture and explained she was one that acted unreasonably. I did acknowledge her concerns, but nothing bad happened we could have just let is slide and went on with our day. She told me I failed as a husband. So we ran the story by our family and friends, it is a a 50/50 split. So my BIL said this would be a funny story for AITA, he frequents the sub. So reddit was I the AITA?

Sorry forgot to add our kid is 19 months old.
