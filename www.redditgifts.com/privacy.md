AITAH for walking out of my sister's wedding after finding out why my son was excluded?

My sister (30f) got married yesterday. I (32m) was so happy for her and agreed to help her out. She told me that the wedding was child free, which I understand, so I asked my best friend if there was anyway he could watch my son and he agreed.

I arrived at the wedding and found that it was not child free. There were probably 15 children there. I was confused but I didn't want to make a scene so I waited until my sister came over to me and I asked her what the deal was.

What she told me broke my heart and I don't know how I can look at her the same way again. She confessed that my son (12m) was excluded because he has an amputated leg. She said that it would draw attention to him at the wedding.

I almost lost it. I could understand if he was going to be disruptive or something, but because of that???? I didn't trust myself in that moment, so I just walked out and went home. When I got home my son asked me why I was back so early so I made up some excuse and then spent the rest of the day having fun with him because it was the only thing keeping me sane.

Since then I've been getting dozens of messages from people saying how me leaving caused my sister to start crying and the whole wedding was ruined, but I honestly don't care right now. I'm a mess. I'm a single dad so I don't have someone to help me right now. But these messages are actually making me wonder: am I the asshole?
