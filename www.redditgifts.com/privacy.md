AITA for no longer seeing a girl bc she’s trans?

I28m work with a trans girl. I would’ve thought she was born a female. She had asked me to the movies and we went on 2x after. On our 3rd day, she told me she was transgender. I was polite, cut the date short, and avoided her at work and was short with texting. Two nights ago she texted me this huge paragraph about how she really liked me and how I hurt her feelings and she wanted an explanation. I told her it wasn’t her but that I simply couldn’t be with someone who was born a male. She got upset and accused me of being transphobic, she said it shouldn’t matter what she was born with because she is all girl now. My two friends think I’m in the wrong because she has had the surgery. Aita

What is a movie you were allowed to see at a young age that traumatized you and made you question if your parents made the right decision by letting you see it?

I’ll go first: My mom let me watch the movie Cujo when I was probably 8 or 9 years old…at night. That movie haunted me for years!! It made me nervous around dogs for a long time. Once I got older and I saw that movie in a list of movies to watch on a streaming program it made me question why the hell would she let me see that movie at such a young age?! Lol another movie I watched back then was Birds, that movie freaked me out too!

What’s yours??

It's been 1 month since Early Access. How would you personally rate Starfield?

Now that we've all had a chance to spend some time with the game, I'm curious how everyone would rate it.

Did it meet your expectations?

Do you like it better or worse than previous BGS games?

Biggest pros and cons?

Please be respectful of each other's opinions. Let's keep the hostility towards each other to a minimum and give people the chance to say their piece.

AITA for telling my wife I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that I can babysit?

My wife Jane (34F) and I (38M) have been together for 5 years. She also brought my step-daughter Emily (9F) into our marriage. We have her for four days a week (M-T) while she's at her dad's Fri-Sun.

From the beginning, Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role. I was only supposed to be a trusted authority figure in case she ever needed anything. I didn't mind and try my best to respect that boundary. She's a sweet child anyway and doesn't cause trouble so it's not like I have to discipline her. Her father is also a good dad.

Emily's dad recently got married and his wife has two kids of her own who are at their place Wednesday to Saturday and at their dads' Sunday to Tuesday. Emily and her new step-siblings don't get along at all. They're always fighting and it's pretty toxic.

Emily's dad asked Jane if they change their custody schedule to match his step-kids' to keep the children apart. It's not a big deal in and of itself because we don't live far from each other so picking and dropping is no issue and she can easily be dropped off to school no matter where she stays. The issue is my wife agreed to it without consulting me.

Jane is currently doing a certification course for the next 12 months and they have classes on Saturdays from 9-5pm. She asked me if I can babysit Emily on Saturdays, but I can't because I play golf with my brother and sister on Saturday mornings from 8am-1pm. This has been our tradition from before Jane and Emily came into my life and I had told Jane from much before that this is important to me and my siblings. She asked if I can move to another day but that's not possible either because my siblings also have jobs and families of their own so Saturday was the best day for us. I told her she can hire a babysitter but she doesn't want to spend money when I can do it for free.

I told her that wouldn't work for me. She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings. That pissed me off so I told her I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that she can have a free babysitter. For the record, I don't have anything against Emily. I've babysat her before and she's a good kid. If there was a family emergency or if it was an occasional occurrence, then yeah I would cancel golf for that day to take care of her but I can't give up something this important to me for 12 months continuous.

She called me a selfish asshole and slept on the couch last night. So AITA?

What games made you really emotional?

I just finished GOW: Ragnarok and boy were there some hard hitting moments throughout the ending. The game hits hard as a father and a veteran. It Takes Two hit hard after going through a divorce. Anything that echoes a real life experience seems to really hit home, which makes sense. Outer Wilds was another game that wrapped up in a beautiful way.

Is there anything that reaches y'all in the same way?
