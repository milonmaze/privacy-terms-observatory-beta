What is a parody that was done so well that most people to this day don't realize it was a parody?
Discussion

Any good examples of this? A movie parody done so convincingly or subtle enough that most people don't even realize that it was meant to be satire?

My wife and I were watching that Kristen Bell Netflix spoof series The Girl In the Window etc. Somehow she had no idea that it was a parody of the genre (seemed pretty blatant to me, from the title alone lol). So it got me wondering about other movies that are actually not known to be parody but in fact are.

How many of you will boycott the World Cup in Qatar? Over 6500 deaths while constructing the infrastructure. Workers were living in squalid accommodations, were forced to pay huge recruitment fees, and had had wages withheld and their passports confiscated.
