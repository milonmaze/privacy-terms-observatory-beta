AITA for grounding my son after he told his sister he doesn't love her during family therapy?

My ex-wife and I have two children together, our 14 year old daughter and 16 year old son. About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.

The issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.

Family therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like "I know you still love your sister-" and my son cut him off and said "No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her." While looking right at her.

The session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful

My father finally said, "you're dead to me, you lazy piece of shit"

Context - My father is a die hard conservative, born in 1952 and comes with all of said baggage. He and I have been back and forth regarding too many things to count. I'm trying to be genuine here, but at the same time honest, he is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and overall xenophobic... He is also extremely work obsessed, I chalk that up to him failing jr high in the 70's and going straight into the work force so that's literally the only thing he knows.

I am extremely fortunate to work for company I like. This being said the company provides time off. As of the time of this posting, Saturday, I have a three day weekend in observation of Juneteenth. I was texting my mother of this (that I'd be available to do dog-sitting on Monday) and received a separate text from my father of, "you're dead to me, you lazy piece of shit" ---- He then went on to explain in horribly written text of how everyone today is entitled and wants days off and does not understand a, "hard day's work" as he puts it.

What bothers me more is that this type of behaviour is still prevalent and people still find the need to destroy themselves at their job, only to come home to sleep and recharge as the only reason you go back to work.
