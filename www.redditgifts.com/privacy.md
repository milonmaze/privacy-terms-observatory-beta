What’s the worst book you’ve ever read?
spoilers in comments

I recently read the Mothman Prophecies by John Keel and I have to by far, it’s the worst book I’ve ever read. Mothman is barely in it and most of the time it’s disorganized, utterly insane ramblings about UFOS and other supernatural phenomena and it goes into un needed detail about UFO contactees and it was so bad, it was good in some parts. It was like getting absolutely plastered by drinking the worst beer possible but still secretly enjoying it. Anyway, I was curious to know, what’s the worst book you’ve ever read?
