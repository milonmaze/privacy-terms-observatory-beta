The upper-middle-class is not your enemy

The people who are making 200k-300k, who drive a Prius and own a 3 bedroom home in a nice neighborhood are not your enemies. Whenever I see people talk about class inequality or "eat the ricch" they somehow think the more well off middle-class people are the ones it's talking about? No, it's talking about the top 1% of the top 1%. I'm closer to the person making minimum wage in terms of lifestyle than I am to those guys.
