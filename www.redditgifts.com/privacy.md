Whatâ€™s a dead give away you grew up poor?

I was having a conversation with a friend and mentioned when a bar of soap gets really thin Iâ€™ve always just stuck it to the new bar and let it dry to get full use out of it. He told me that was my dead giveaway.

whats a game that you got significantly far into, only to realize you were doing something wrong or missing a key feature/ability altogether?

For me, I played bloodborne for about six hours before realizing I could use light attack with r1. I kept doing a full swing with the hunter axe for every strike. Somehow got through gascoigne and cleric beast until realizing. Yes, that took me minimum six hours, first fromsoft game. (And by far my favorite)
