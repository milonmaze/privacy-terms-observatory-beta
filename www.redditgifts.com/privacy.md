I desperately need a sanity check. Is there anyone else here who is completely done with conservative men and doesn't care about their feelings?
/r/all

American 25/w here. I recently made a friend with a man while I was out and about playing pokemon go. We started texting and had known each other for about two weeks before he told me that he's a conservative and to "not judge him". Fuck that. I am judging you extremely hard and I'll never be your friend. I'll never be friends with someone who votes in oppressive bigots who don't even have more than two brain cells to rub together. This guy said that I was being a bit extreme and judgmental. Huh, I wish I cared. I have one less constitutional right now and you've voted this trash in. Bye bye. I'm so completely done with conservatives that I don't even care to ask what the details of their personal views are and what legislation they support. I don't care, fuck all the way off.

Quick edit! First, thank you kindly for the supportive words. And a couple awards, whoa! Thank you! I was not expecting this post to get much attention at all and should have worded it better. I was frustrated with one man in particular while writing the post, so I focused on "conservative men" more so than "conservative people."

I am equally frustrated with both conservative men and women. Well, no, scratch that. While conservative women may have absolutely abhorrent politics, nobody is more butt hurt than a conservative man who can't get his dick wet.
