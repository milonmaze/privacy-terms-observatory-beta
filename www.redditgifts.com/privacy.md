Me [M33] and my wife [F30] were robbed while we were out on a date. My wife is mad I didn’t “stand up for her”. AITAH for not risking our lives over our wallets.
NSFW

Me and my wife were out on the town for a date night (we don’t get to go out often). Everything was fine, had a few drinks, and finally decided to walk home. We only live a few blocks from the restaurant we were at and never had any issues in the past (live in a somewhat nice upper middle class area). We decide to cut through the park have a night romantic walk at night.

Well shortly after we get approached by two guys who present, what we believe, are guns demanding our phone/wallets. We are totally caught by surprise and freaked out sowe hand everything over. They get more elevated and tell us to “take off your shit”. Now I’m starting to panic, obviously, but what he hell am I going to do against a gun. Long story short, I look at my wife and start to take my shirt off. She hesitates but does the same. Eventually me and my wife end up in nothing but our underwear as they take off.

We eventually flag down a car and get them to call the police. They give us something to cover up and file a report. Cop is cold and really seems not to care. We assume nothing will come of it.

Well the next day my wife refuses to talk about it. Obviously she’s upset and I want to give her space. But today she confronts me fuming that I didn’t “protect her”. It explodes into a big fight but what am I supposed to do fight two armed men to save us from walking down the street in our underwear and losing some cash (canceled are cards fairly quickly).

I really have no idea what else she expected me to do. They didn’t touch us or physically hurt us in anyway. AITHA?
