Alcohol is a bigger problem in the US than guns.

Last year, 20,000 people died to gun violence in the US.

Alcohol-related deaths in the United States have been estimated to be over 140,000 each year. This makes alcohol the fourth-leading preventable cause of death in the United States.

People drink a substance that alters their personality or judgement, but don't seem to think that's dangerous or contributes to dangerous activity.

AITAH for not letting my wife come to my family dinner?

throwaway

My (36M) parents (67M and 69F) who live in another city, invited me, my siblings and our kids (mine are 5F and 4M) to come to dinner. We will be gone for 3 days. Our spouses weren't invited. My wife (36F) asked if she could come. I told her that my parents didn't invite spouses.

She said it sounded fun and asked if I could ask them about it. I said that I didn't want to ask them and bother them with extra guests. She said she wouldn't be a burden at all. I didn't really want to ask my parents, they would agree even if they didn't really want to. I said that we would be gone for just a couple of days and that it wouldn't be that fun, just normal visits and dinners. She didn't argue much longer and said it was fine.

I took my kids and went to my parents. My BIL and my SIL were there (one BIL wasn't there). Apparently they called to ask if they could come. My parents if they could come and my parents said: "You don't need to ask". They asked me about my wife and I told them I didn't bring her along. My 5-year-old said that her mommy wanted to come but Daddy said no. My parents were surprised and asked me why. I explained to them my reasons. And they said that I should've brought her especially since she wanted to. My father especially was slightly mad at me and said it wasn't very nice of me. Now she won't have anyone to spend time with. She does not like being alone in peace. He felt sad about it.

I felt kinda bad. AITAH?

AITA for telling my son he has to wear clothes?

My son (M19) loves to just wear underwear in his room for whatever reason. He‚Äôll throw on a shirt and pants if he has to step out to go to the bathroom, come to the kitchen, talk to anybody, etc but otherwise he‚Äôs just in his underwear.

I‚Äôve (M48) told him multiple times that I dislike this and that he has to wear clothes in case his mom or I have to come into his room. He says that if we start knocking he‚Äôll throw something on and then it‚Äôll be okay. I told him he still has to wear clothes and then he made another excuse and said it was too hot.

In the summer I tend to set the thermostat to around 85 or 87 to save money. I turn it down to around 80-82 once the sun goes down because then it takes less energy. He says that it makes him sweat when he‚Äôs just sitting around not doing anything and I rejoined by saying ‚Äúif it‚Äôs so hot go spend a couple hours outside, see if it still feels hot‚Äù- we live in Oklahoma and it routinely gets up to 100 in the summers.

He rolled his eyes at this and we just kept arguing. I‚Äôm wondering now if I‚Äôm the asshole. Am I?

If I traveled back 22 years, whom do I have to talk to in order to prevent 9/11?

The way I see it, there are two possible directions that this scenario could take:

I travel back in time to September 9, 2001 and it's my current mind in a child's body. I could attempt to get the attention of my parents or my elementary school principal, neither of whom would do anything but laugh at me.

I travel back in time to September 9, 2001 and it's my current adult self. I could attempt to get the attention of my local police station or news channel, neither of whom would do anything but laugh at me.

Either way, it seems that if I were to invent a time machine and travel back 22 years, there's nothing I could actually do to prevent 9/11. Even if I somehow made it to the World Trade Center and pulled the fire alarms to evacuate the skyscrapers, that wouldn't stop any of the people on the four planes from dying. So how could an ordinary person convince the authorities to stop the hijackers from boarding the planes without any evidence? I feel like, even today, if I could predict a terrorist attack a few days into the future, there's nobody I could talk to who is powerful enough to do anything about it.

Are you aging into any form of more Conservative thinking?

We read a lot about how millennials are not getting more conservative as they age like other generations may have. Personally after the war in Iraq I don't think I could ever vote R in my life, not that they've given me any reason to. But certain Gen-Z causes are kind of foreign to me. I'd say I'm pretty economically Liberal but socially more moderate than young people. I'm really turned off by identity politics for example. What about you?

What‚Äôs a game you 100% believe lived up to the hype?

I‚Äôm sure we all have our stories of being excited about a game and then being disappointed when playing it but it‚Äôs always special when a game really is that good.

I have several examples like RE4 Remake Skyrim Death Stranding Fallout 4 but my favorites are Breath Of The Wild and Tears of The Kingdom.

To me Nintendo somehow recreated just how groundbreaking Ocarina Of Time felt with Botw somehow and then made it even better with Totk

Horror movie monster reveals that ruined the movie

This post was inspired by the "that one scene" post because it got me thinking how sometimes in horror movies the monster reveal actually ruins the entire movie for me. Good examples for me are Cloverfield and The babadook. Why for the love of god would you reveal the monster ?!?!?!..... those movies were amazing because they built so much tension and fright without showing us anything. Ruined the movie revealing the monster.

A horror movie that nailed this concept was OG Blair Witch Project particularly the ending scene. The audience never sees anything but we hear the screaming and breathing and the last visual we have left is the video going to static. No monster reveal needed and couldn't sleep right for days.

What are other horror movies were ruined by the "reveal"?

I almost skipped this game due to reddit and youtube reviews

I just finished the first 2-3 hours of the game and it is getting more and more addicting the more I discover and learn.

I can‚Äôt believe I almost skipped this game due to random youtube reviews and all the negativity on reddit. I think I have a problem where if I start seeing bad reviews and just bad topics in general surrounding a game it kind of kills the hype and enjoyment for me as I start seeing these issues.

I may have to just stop looking at reviews and specific subs when a game I am looking forward to is releasing.
