My wife thinks it's completely fine to go to a sit-down restaurant at 9:51pm when they close at 10pm

We had a sitter for the kids last night so we ate (at home) and then got out the door to catch a movie as soon as the sitter got here. It was a pretty long movie, so we were both really hungry again afterward. She was craving pizza from one of our favorite local places that was only a 2-3 min walk, so without even realizing what time it was, we started in that direction.

Well, as we came thru the door I could see the place was completely empty. They close at 10 pm and it was 9:51 or something. My wife could see I was wanting to leave but she was being really difficult and I HATE having arguments when we're in public...so I went along with it.

She's done this before at 20-30 mins before closing times, but never this late. All I can say is it made me feel really uncomfortable. I've never been a server but I could tell from their faces that they were really f*ucking annoyed.

And of course, she had to order one of the specialty pizzas with all this extra shit on it. Once the waitress left, I only somewhat jokingly said "They're gonna spit on your pizza." She could sense the sarcasm in my voice and asked what my deal was. I explained to her how I was uncomfortable going into a sit-down restaurant when it's this close to closing time.

She was upset by this and got really defensive and said it's their job to serve customers until the stated closing time. She said if they're open, we should be able to dine there. I tried to explain that the staff probably wants to clean up and go home, and it's just common courtesy not to barge in right at the last minute.

AITA for not letting my GF eat the naan bread we ordered?

My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time.

This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom.

My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?

Am i for refusing to weigh myself in front of my partner

Backstory: I (F) and fiancé (M) have broken up over this. Need some impartial opinions if i am asshole.

I am very insecure about my weight and put on over 10kg through covid, work stress and grief.

I received an ultimatum in July from my fiancée that if I didnt lose 4kg by my birthday (yesterday) the wedding at the end of this year is off and demanded to know what my starting weight was. I was really distress/sad by this at the time of request that I couldnt even engage with him for a week. I even saw a psychologist to help me process it. I eventually cracked and told him my weight (76kg). We don’t live together. I work really hard and lose 5kg in about 5 weeks. Yesterday was my birthday, the weigh in day, he came over to visit.

First thing in the morning i want to get this over with (still upset by the whole experience) and I stood on the scale in my pjs with my weight coming in at just over 70kg which he looks at and verbalizes. He weighs himself then asks me to come back and re-weigh myself in front of him without any clothes on. I refuse. My reasoning was that I already felt humiliated and I was mentally only prepared to do it once which in my mind I did.

He thinks I’m the asshole because I refuse to do something that was important to him. I think he’s the asshole for making me go through this experience. I texted a single trusted friend who gave me some reassuring words (essentially that I’m not crazy and this isnt my fault) which i shared with him not saying who the friend (F) was. He thinks that is not impartial and i’m badmouthing him. We broke up over my refusal to re-weigh myself in front of him without clothes on.

I know people who are impartial…. The internet!. Am i being unreasonable/the ah in not doing something that was important to him?

How can I convince my wife that psychics aren't real?

I recently found out that she visited a psychic, and I spent an hour or more explaining that psychics have been thoroughly debunked, including their methods of cold and hot reading, and even explained how her own session was full of misses that the psychic was able to steer back into a hit without her even noticing. I really don't know what to do, short of studying psychic techniques and using them on her to prove that it's fake. However, I told her I would try that, and she told me that if I could convince her I had psychic abilities, then the most reasonable explanation is that I am, in fact, psychic. Dear God someone help me.

Edit: this really isn't that serious, or some pivotal point of our marriage. Also, yes I believe in gravity. Some of you people...

Edit again: you people have bombarded me to the point that I've realized how much I truly don't give a shit about this topic. If I respond to your comment, just know I'm being a smart ass.

FINAL EDIT (probably) Congratulations, 414 of you apparently have dyslexia. If you can read this, please make an appointment with your friendly neighborhood optometrist or whoever diagnoses dyslexia at your earliest convenience.

I(32M) am divorcing my wife (33F) after finding out that my son(5M) is not mine.

Well, a couple of weeks ago I found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago, the way I found out is that her sister told me after going to visit her to find out how the delivery of her first child was, she confessed to me that 6 years ago my wife told her that she slept drunk with her best friend, in her words, my wife was very sorry.

At the time she told me I was with my "son" and immediately after leaving her house I went to take a paternity test with him, fearing the worst.

A week later I get the results and my fears came true, my son is not mine, for some reason, I began to see the boy differently, more as an acquaintance than a son, with proofs in hand I confronted my wife at night when the child was sleeping, she asked me who told me and I simply told her that it is none of her business, although obviously it will not take long to connect the dots that it was her sister, well, that is not my problem now.

Regardless of that, I asked her for a divorce, which is now in process, she was "devastated", she swore to me more than once that nothing happened with anyone again, that she has been faithful to me in body and soul since then, I held back the urge to insult her to avoid complications during the divorce issue, not believing a word she said, mostly blaming the alcohol instead of taking the blame herself.

After talking about it, she threatened me saying that she would demand full custody of the child, I was so annoyed at that moment that I told her okay, I don't want anything to do with something that is not mine, that she keep the child and I'll keep the dogs (we have two dogs that we adopted as puppies and they are currently 8 years old each) after my words she tried to convince me to take care of the child with her, that I am his father, at that moment I exploded, I was so angry and I had held back so much the urge to scream that I just yelled her to go and take her bastard with her.

A week has passed since that and I am at home (it is in my name because it is a gift from my parents), she went to her parents' house with her kid, she has not called me since then, she left with everything and the half-asleep kid when I yelled at her, especially since it was the first time I really yelled at her, it sure affected her.

I talked to my parents and my dad told me that I did the right thing and that I shouldn't be raising something that is not of my blood, and I agree with him, however, the pain is still there, my younger brother told me to write here to entertain myself, I am currently seeing a therapist 3 times a week, who told me that I have already taken the first step, which was to leave behind what causes me pain, it just hurts to know that my family no longer exists.

Regarding why my sister-in-law told me everything, according to her, she felt guilty seeing me always happy with my son, knowing that he may not be mine, and that the fact that we went to visit her in a moment of weakness caused her to completely break down with guilt, I don't know how true that is, I just know that right now I feel tremendous hatred for my wife and a feeling between pain and resentment for the child, although it's just time to get ahead.

I just hope the divorce goes smoothly, we have separate financers and properties and if she really asks for child support I have proof that it's not mine, according to my lawyer that's more than enough if she tries a legal process for that, my therapist also recommended that I not see him nor her, that regardless of the child's feelings, I should focus on my own first, that the child is no longer my problem and the sooner I accept it, the better.

Sorry for the misspellings, English is not my first language.

TIL that if Bill Gates told a Microsoft employee "You’re full of shit. That’s the stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever heard", that meant that the software mogul was amazed and impressed. "In the lore of Microsoft, if Bill says that to you, you’re made", an employee said.

Am I the a***hole for charging my sister for being her wedding photographer?

I 23 f, am a photographer. I have been doing photography for 3 years now (I did not went to school for it but I have payed for some courses professional photographers offer) so far my photography journey has been successful and I enjoy being my own boss. When I first told my parents and siblings I was going to take photography serious they were supportive. However, I didn’t know if my older sister was. When I started I was looking for models to practice, I remember asking my older sister (which is 1 year older then me) if I could photograph her and her boyfriend at the time, as I needed more practice on couple photoshoots.I told her I wanted to take the photos at a specific place, in which she replied “eh idk, that place is too far”. I understood and started to look for other places closer from home. The next day she gave a date in which she was free and I could take some photos and changing her mind of actually going to the place I recommended. I was super excited to shoot and practice my editing skills! Well it came to that day and she did not mentioned anything about the photoshoot but I was ready and excited so I asked her what time we were leaving as she replied that her and her boyfriend were gonna go to that place together to hangout. I mentioned if I was going to take her photos and she gave me a nasty look and said no. I kinda got butthurt that they were both leaving to the place I recommended to her to take Pictures but I didn’t make a big deal about it. Since then I have not asked her to help me with anything. Anyway, now 3 years later, my sister is getting married (to the same guy he was dating 3 years ago). I looked at my schedule and I had a spot open for the day of her wedding. My mom asked me if I could be my sisters wedding photographer and I could give her a discount. I actually thought about it since I was still gonna get payed for my services. However when my sister talked to me she asked if I could take her wedding Picture completely FREE because she’s family. I nicely denied and I told her that my photography is a business and I would like to get payed for my services and time. She looked shocked she and told me that all I was gonna do are edit pictures and that only took a few hours. I again denied and told her to talk to me when she decides to respect my business and time because photography (specifically weeding photography) is not easy. She told me I was an ah for charging her and was going to tell my parents. My parents are supportive and understanding that photography is a business for me and I should be paid no matter if it’s family or friends. They mentioned how I agreed to give her a discount but she rudely denied as she said that she’s in a tight budget and was not going to pay me for just some pictures. I could not hear her disrespect me or my business that I worked so hard for it to be successful so I left the room and told her give me a call when she changes her mind :) A few weeks already passed and have not heard anything from her and I have not gotten an invitation for her wedding. My parents are trying to make her understand the situation but she already decided that she does not want me in her wedding (for what she has told my parents). I don’t know what to do and I do feel bad for charging my sister but I also value my work and I would like for her to at least respect that. So am I the a***h? :/
