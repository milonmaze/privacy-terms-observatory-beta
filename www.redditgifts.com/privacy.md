She called me cheap for suggesting to split the check on our first date

I went to a mall yesterday to buy a pair of sunglasses. I met the sales attendant and asked for a specific pair of sunglasses. She immediately replied that they don't carry them in-store, and I'd have to order them online. She asked if I'm interested in trying any other pairs, and I said okay. We started talking through the process, and we hit it off really quickly and realized we have so much in common. We shared a lot of things, life experiences. I complimented her hair; it was beautiful. She started showing pictures of herself with long hair from her phone, and I did too. I had a ponytail a few months ago. We had a good time and great conversations. I ended up buying the sunglasses and said thanks for the talk and that I like her.

She asked what I'm doing later and if I wanted to hang out after her work. She said she'd love to continue our conversations. We exchanged Instagram IDs and added each other. We continued our conversations later that night until around 3 am.

Today I asked her if she wanted to get some coffee sometime in the evening. She said okay, and I asked her to pick a place where she feels comfortable. She replied that she would text me the place and time. Around 5 pm, she texted me the address of a fancy seafood place. I reminded her that we were only planning a coffee date. She said she wants to go to this restaurant, and we could have a peaceful time talking there. I jokingly said, "Well, we're gonna have to split the bill." She didn't respond for some time. Then she said, and I quote, "If you can afford those sunglasses, you sure can afford to pay a fancy bill." I responded that I can pay the bill, but I won't because we're just getting to know each other, and that's why I suggested a coffee date.

She called me cheap for not choosing to take a beautiful woman to a fancy restaurant, and I'm on the losing side.

I just said it was nice knowing her.

Update:

Thank you to everyone for assuring me that I made a good decision. And to those who are calling me cheap in my DMs, I don't consider myself a cheap person. I would have happily paid for the coffee I suggested. My idea was for us to get to know each other better over a coffee, and if things went well, I had no issues with treating her to a nice date. I think I'm old-fashioned because when she called me cheap, I didn't feel good about it.

Today, I actually made a reservation at the same seafood place she wanted to go to, but the reservation is only for myself. I didn't invite her. I went there, had a nice dinner, took a photo, and posted it on my Instagram story. She is still added to my Instagram, and she saw it. I feel bad for doing this, but I wanted to show that I'm not cheap. It's just me.

Thanks.
