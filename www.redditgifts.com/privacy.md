AITA for asking my ex-wife to stop making my kids jealous and flaunting

So Iâ€™ve (m38) been divorced from my ex wife (f35) for 10 years. And we have two kids together (m12 and m10)

I remarried a year late while sheâ€™s still single. I have 3 further kids (f9, f7 f3).

I have my sons over every weekend. About 4 years, my ex wife opened up a online business and sheâ€™s been making 6 figures. While my wife is a stay at home mum and I make 30k to support our family.

So you can imagine how this difference has effected our 2 households. They live in a gated community, she drives a 2022 rsq3. And she and our sons go on 2 extravagant holidays a year.

My sons came over this weekend and starting tell me and the girls theyâ€™re going on a Disney concierge cruise in the summer. My daughters started crying saying daddy we wanna go, and when I looked online for the prices theyâ€™re priced at $5k per person.

Itâ€™s been all theyâ€™ve talking about non-stop. I feel like their wealth is being shoved down our throats, when we can barely afford heating this Christmas.

Itâ€™s hard not to be hateful but I sent her a long text saying stop trying to make us feel less than. I also told my sons in private pls donâ€™t mention holidays or gifts around the girls.

She replied with saying itâ€™s not her problem how we feel, and when she does nice things for the boys. Me and my wife are the last people on her mind?

am I reading into this too much? Or am I the asshole for saying sheâ€™s spiteful?
