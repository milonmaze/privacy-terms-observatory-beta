TIL that in Starship Troopers (1997) the crew used over 300,000 blank rounds. Thought to be a record at the time and due the following years of CGI, the record probably has never been broken.

AITA for refusing to cook separate meal for my niece ?

I (F42) live with my husband (M45) and our daughters (F18 & F16). We live in a different city from our families due to work.

A few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours.

I knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us.

Kate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying.

The issue was with food. She had turned vegan.

Normally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple.

Kate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine.

Since her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants.

But everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea.

It came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself.

My sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side.

AITA ?

A significant number of people are mentally addicted to weed, to the point they can't function in the real world when sober.

Everyone loves to point to the fact that people don't have dangerous physical withdrawals from weed to make the case that you can't be addicted to it. But you absolutely can, mentally.

A depressing number of people start their day by vaping or popping an edible and then try to maintain that high all day until they go to sleep. They simply cannot handle the world without it.

What musical album is more of an experience / feeling than just an 'album'?

I'm drunk and listening to the Dark side of the moon for the first time. It feels like a trip / experience. Wondering if there are any albums that have the same effect. Doesn't have to be the same genre

AITAH for telling my GF I‚Äôm not ready to marry her

My (30M) GF (30F) have been together for a year and a half. We live together in a house I bought alone. Honestly, she‚Äôs an amazing person. She‚Äôs extremely caring, thoughtful, sexy, always in ‚Äúthe mood‚Äù, etc. She‚Äôs a sexy saint.

However, we see life very very differently. With money for instance, I make more than double her income and because of this, I pay the vast majority of the bills, which I‚Äôm honestly fine with. She helps out with groceries and some bills, it works. The problem is that, she has lots of disposable income and she treats it as such. She NEVER has money for the things she needs. Her car has problems, she needs to borrow money from me, she wants to go on vacation, she racks up massive credit card bills. She generally owes me between $1k-$4k at any given time, and when she starts paying me back, she inevitably needs to borrow more at some point. I know she‚Äôs not on drugs, she literally spends it all on useless crap; constantly replacing our dishes, for example.

She‚Äôs extremely difficult to communicate with and reacts very harshly to things that make no sense to me. For example, I was engaged before we got together (she knew this). I‚Äôve had junk mail show up with my exes name and I got absolutely blasted from her. She threatens to pack up and leave because of things like this, that I don‚Äôt think I have control over. And she will NOT explain why she‚Äôs so mad about it.

Lots of things like this have been building. Recently, the straw the broke the camels back and destroyed my ‚Äúspark‚Äù for her happened. She talked about marriage, having kids, etc. I asked her why she wants to get married and she said ‚Äúbecause she wants to throw a party.‚Äù This seems wildly inappropriate and a weak reason to make such a strong commitment.

So I told her I‚Äôm not ready to marry her because of the reasons above, and similar things that aren‚Äôt mentioned for length purposes. She lost her mind, cried, said she was going to pack up, said things are not salvageable, then changed her mind and wants to work it out. AITAH?
