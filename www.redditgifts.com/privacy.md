What movie has the perfect soundtrack?
Discussion

Many franchises are considered to have the most remarkable soundtracks(hp,lotr,sw...) but at the same time the composers of the songs that follow the story have all an unique style for creating the themes that are part of the film.

The composer that is considered as the father of all movie songs(at least for most people) is john willians. Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.

For me, something that really has a big weight on forming this kind of opinion is the nostalgia relationed to the movie at the time the person watched it(like childhood or teenage years).

So, what movie has the best soundtrack ever for you?
