AITAH for not wanting to get a vasectomy after my last child was recently born?

I (28)M donâ€™t want to get a vasectomy. My (25)F wife obviously wants me too.

We have two kids together one born just a week ago. Everyone she has talked to about it has said I am an asshole for not wanting to go get it done and tells her how selfish I am.

I feel like I shouldnâ€™t have to get this done against my will just because she wants me too. Iâ€™ve told her Iâ€™m fine using protection from now on (we never have before) and if that wasnâ€™t okay then we could just avoid sex altogether.

I can understand this being an issue for her since she doesnâ€™t want more kids but if itâ€™s truly that big of a deal why wasnâ€™t it brought up sooner to be discussed? Maybe I am crazy but it just feels wrong that Iâ€™m being pressured into this to me.

So AITAH here?

Edit: I appreciate all the feedback I have received from the post. I have seen arguments for both sides but it is helping see from her perspective better. We will likely sit down and talk about it soon when we get the chance again.

Edit 2: A lot of people keep saying I suck for mentioning no sex. Neither of us are super sexual people to begin with. Once a week at most, once a month is more typical we have always been that way our entire lives before we met and now. Itâ€™s not something we view as important I guess is what Iâ€™m saying. We were mainly sexual because we wanted kids. Not the typical relationship Iâ€™m aware.
