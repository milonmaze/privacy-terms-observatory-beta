AITA for having my mom come over so I could take a shower while she watched my newborn?

My husband and I had a baby 2 weeks ago. She is strictly breastfed and not only does she cluster feed but she also just finds comfort in being close to me. Therefore, there's not much I can do without her and more often than not, I'm completely okay with that. But one thing this does mean is that I don't get to shower by myself. I've showered once by myself since having her and it only lasted long enough for me to soap up before she was crying and my husband was bringing her in to me. I think I literally had all of 2-3 minutes.

With that said, my husband of course hasn't had to change his life around at all. Every day and nearly every night he is taking 30-60 minute uninterrupted showers. He doesn't understand the frustration I get whenever he showers. That's the only thing that bothers me. I want to shower. I want to sit under the water and relax my muscles. But like I said, every time I attempt it, the baby starts crying and he brings her in to the shower with me instead of trying to calm her down himself and he says it's because he knows that showers calm her down and he doesn't like her crying (he feels bad- like it nearly makes him cry whenever she does). So I get his thought process but it feels like a cop out at the same time. So I called my mom and asked her to come watch the baby so I could shower and shave my legs because I've literally been attempting to shave my legs for 5 days now and it's all patchy because I keep having the baby handed off to me. I need to self care. My husband was home when I asked my mom to come by. I didn't tell him. She shows up and takes the baby and I go to shower. My husband comes in at some point and asks why my mom is here and I tell him I asked her to come by so I could shower without the baby being handed off to me. He says "I could have watched her, why would you do that?" So I said "every time you watch her while I shower, she ends up in here with me within 2 minutes of me being in here because you don't even try to calm her down." Now he thinks I'm an AH because I "never told him to keep the baby out of the shower", despite me specifically saying I wanted to relax and self care multiple times. AITA? He says I've now made him look bad to my mom.

Why isn't "giving birth is painful" among the most common reason for not having children?

I haven't personally experienced it but it seems like giving birth is one of the most painful things you can experience, so logically you would expect it to be a very common reason why women don't want to have children.

However, when listing reasons why they don't want children, women say things like i want to focus on career, i'm afraid of responsibility, overpopulation, etc. etc. actually, i think i've never heard/read any woman even mention pain among these reasons, let alone state it as the main reason.

AITA for refusing to send my daughter to public school or ask my BIL to pay for my step kids to go to private school?

I (25F) have a daughter (8F). I had her when I was very young and her father was never in the picture. My older sister (34F) and her husband (39M) have helped me a lot. Raising my daughter alone and going to college would have been impossible without them. My sister is a SAHM and my BIL is quite wealthy due to his family business. They pay for my daughter to go to the same private school as their kids (11M, 8F, and 6F). It’s very expensive but my BIL can afford it and I’m very grateful to them for giving my daughter more opportunities.

I recently got married and my husband (36M) has three daughters (12, 9, 7). They go to our local public school, which is good but not as good as the private school my daughter goes to. Last night he told me that he thinks it isn’t fair that my daughter goes to a 40k/year private school while his daughters have to go to public school. He said that next year I need to either send my daughter to public school or ask my BIL to pay for his daughters to go to private school. I told him that I’m not doing that because I want my daughter to have all the opportunities I didn’t have (I went to a shitty inner city public school) and my BIL can’t afford to send seven kids to private school. He got mad at me and said that our kids are siblings now and everything needs to be equal between them. AITA?
