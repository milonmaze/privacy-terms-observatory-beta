LPT: If you love box mac and cheese, you can buy a big jar of the cheese powder online and turn any pasta into the delicious trash gourmet mac of your dreams.
Food & Drink

I honestly can barely believe it. High me was doing some shopping on the zon and was like, damn I wish I had some mac and cheese. After a weird succession of searching I found the motherload. A bucket of the cheese powder. I thought you had to buy THE box mix forever. It’s so much cheaper and you can make as little or as disgustingly much as you want. Good tip for parents but also grown up trash humans who wanna crush a bunch of deliciousness. The kind I got is called “big daddy” but I’m sure they’re all in the same boat of neon orange goodness.

Edit: Ok so I figured everyone would find their own since there are a million, but this is what I bought and have been loving:

Hoosier Hill Farm Big Daddy Mac Mix, 1 Pound https://a.co/d/7kdinuM (A bunch of folks recommended nuts.com so we don’t give bezos another trip to space)

I followed the “recipe” on the jar and my first batch had wayyyy too much flavor - thought I’d made a big mistake. Cut it in like half and tweaked it from there and am loving it now. And it’s gonna last me way longer now too.
