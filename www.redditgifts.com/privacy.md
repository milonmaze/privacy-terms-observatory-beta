What do white people have for Thanksgiving?

I ask this genuinely and respectfully, my sister and I are both black and both sides of our family serve a lot of soul food and typical african american or southern food (gumbo, candied yams, sweet potato pie, mac and cheese, collard greens, hot water corn bread, etc.) plus standard thanksgiving food like turkey and stuffing and we just recently asked ourselves what do white people serve because we genuinely don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm actually curious non-black families (all family‚Äôs not just white one‚Äôs) eat during thanksgiving but white families are the ones I know the least about.
