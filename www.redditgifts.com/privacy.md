AITA for lying to family and friends about who's the infertile one between my wife and I?

My wife ( 32F) and I (32M) have been married for 7 years and been having unprotected sex for three years trying to have a baby.

It has taken a toll on our marriage and I admit that many times I have complained to family, friends, and coworkers about my wife's infertility.

What I thought was my wife's infertility. Maybe it is because we live in Utah but whenever the idea of us being infertile came up, people just swarmed in giving my wife recommendations to fertility specialists.

The talk was always " Oh, my wife saw Dr. Whatever, and we ended up having twins." Or " Maybe your wife is just too stressed out."

And I believed it because my wife contracted TB when she was 20 and volunteering in another country. Her primary care who she saw when she was back home just flippantly told her that TB could effect the genital area and prevent her body from housing a baby ( but obviously he said it in medical lingo.)

We finally find a doctor who straight up told us that there was nothing wrong with her fallopian tubes, or her endometrium. She suggested I get tested to see that I'm not the problem.

The verdict comes back that I am the one with very low sperm count. I was so shocked and went to get another opinion which told me the same thing.

I felt so shaken. And because a lot of people knew about our struggles, they also knew we went to a doctor again. At a family and friends gathering people started asking me about what we found out, and I just panicked and said that my wife's TB was likely the cause, but not 100 percent necessarily.

People saw that as my wife being the problem and somebody even suggested I go through with divorcing her since I was 32 and complaining about being childless. Saying I could be a dad within a year since it was short marriage.

What I did not realize was that my mom and aunt would jump on that suggestion and start telling friends and their kids that I was getting a divorce, and that this was my wife's fault because she shouldn't have been so reckless when she was young.

What was worse was some people thought it wasn't even TB but a " bacterial genital disease." This all got back to my wife through a friend and she is furious.

She said that she could not believe I've been painting her as the problem when she wasn't even the problem. And that she was tired of the pitying or disapproving looks she was getting in our small town and that I needed to set the record straight or at least tell everybody to shut up and that we are not divorcing.

AITA? I panicked and I felt like I didn't completely lie because TB could be exacerbating our problem. But my mom really screwed things up by making it malicious. Now I'm in over my head and feel really bad.
