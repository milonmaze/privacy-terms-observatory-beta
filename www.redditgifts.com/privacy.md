please don't support the 'ser Aylin' mod

just so everyone is aware... 'ser Aylin' is not just some random harmless mod that changes Aylin's gender for the fun of it. it's part of a mod pack (housed on another website since most of the mods obviously got taken down from Nexus) called the 'no alphabets' mod which aims to remove every single queer character and every single reference to any queer identity from the entire game, and if that wasn't bad enough the mod creator is also working on removing people of color from the game...

on the website they state that the mod "ensures that the gender and sexuality of world NPCs match medieval status quo" and I was not even slightly surprised to see that instead of just removing the references to being trans they instead decided that the easier thing to do (it's not easier) was to turn her into a man who tried to be a woman and then hated it... gee I wonder why they'd do that?and imagine my surprise when I saw that they had no mods that removed any of the magical aspects and creatures in the game in order to make it match "medieval status quo."it's almost as if they don't care about realism and it's actually just about their hatred of queer people, because if they did care about realism they'd be well aware that we have existed since the dawn of time.

the same person who made these mods also created the infamous mod that "fixes" Wyll and his father by making them both white, and the comments are filled with people (including the creator of the mod) who are so excited that they can finally romance Wyll now that they've made him white which is baffling... there were even talks of replacing Wyll's voice with a "white voice" because how are they ever going to be able to enjoy the game when there's still a Black man voicing one of the characters?

oh and this feels fucking random but you know Vitiligo? the disorder that was first described over 1500 years BC? yeah, that's something they're removing too for "realism."

if you're still somehow doubting that there's malicious intent then maybe the fact that someone who was helping the creator called two gay men in the game the f-slur in a list of things they wanted removed from the game and the mod author just replied by thanking them for the help. and I'm sure there's a shit ton more of that if you keep scrolling through it but I couldn't stomach reading any more of it.

they're actually trying to create their own white supremacist paradise... I left a comment informing everyone of all of this and I was blocked within about 20 seconds of posting it.

please don't support this garbage. there is enough hate in the world already.

EDIT: hate to state the obvious, but no... ignoring nazis is actually not the right way to deal with them. disturbing their peace and forcing their actions into the light is. if your focus is on a stranger online not exposing nazis in the exact way you think they should have done it and not on the actual nazis then take a little time to reflect on why that's your priority. I honestly think the biggest mistake I made here was making the title specifically about the mod, and not the group of white supremacists. that is the literal only regret I have.

STEVE-O HERE! ASK ME ANYTHING!!!

Hey Everyone, this is Steve-O (Here's a photo for proof: https://postimg.cc/VS4Yn7tm). If you don't know about me, I was on an MTV show called Jackass over twenty years ago and, somehow, it was still a thing twenty years later. I identify as an all-around entertainer, I love animals (hence, my Reddit handle is "StreetDogLover") and have plans to open an animal sanctuary with my fiancee on a property we just bought in Tennessee. I recently finished touring the world with a truly insane multi-media comedy show called "Steve-O's Bucket List", and I'm thrilled to let you all know that the show is streaming now for a limited time at steveo.com. I think that covers it, now, let's fuckin' go!!! YEAH DUDE!!!

THANKS, EVERYONE! After more than five hours, I'm calling it a day! Please upvote and share this AMA on other subs and/or any other way that works! Also, please do enjoy my new Bucket List special. Until next time! WOOHOO!!!

TIFU: By flowering while showering into my 20s

This happened many years ago, when I was but a young man in college. But the story actually starts about 18 years before that, when I was a baby.

Like most kids, I hated getting soap in my eyes in the bath. Even the gentle “baby shampoo” would send me into a rage. My dad, being the intrepid problem solving sort with a penchant for over engineering, came up with a sort of 360 degree visor that my hair would stick through. Then, they could wash my hair and the soapy water would just roll off. It was great. It kind of looked like a flower on my head, so my parents would say I was “flowering while showering.”

Eventually, the OG visor got mildew and was disposed of, but my dad made a few over the years. He ultimately stopped when he decided that I should be able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I wasn’t having it and started making my own. Over time, “flower hats” for this exact purpose became mass produced and I switched over to just buying them as needed. Never got soap in my eyes! It was great!

Well, by the time I was 20 and living in my own apartment in college, I still hadn’t kicked the ol’ flower hat. I was flowering while showering every day, living my best life. Cue a cute girl staying at my place and suggesting we take a shower together before fucking. She asked me to wash her hair and brush conditioner through it, which apparently felt really good to her and was a major turn on. When I was done, she offered to wash my hair. I didn’t think that would do anything for me, but I said “sure!”

I then reached out of the shower for the drawer where I kept my flower hat and put it on. At first she laughed and thought I was joking, even after I explained what it was. But then I think she noticed how it looked kind of old and used and faded, and that it would be strangely elaborate to keep a flower hat in my bathroom for the occasional joke.

To her credit, she washed my hair while I wore it. We didn’t end up having sex that night—I can’t remember her explanation—but after she left the next morning she didn’t return my calls or AIM messages.

I didn’t stop flowering while showering immediately after that. I would just say, “oh, I washed my hair already” if the situation came up again. But when I met my now-wife, I knew it was time to give it up. So I no longer flower while I shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.

But you better believe that when we had kids, I immediately got them flower hats. My wife thinks they’re brilliant. She has no idea of my dark past. And every once in a while I look at my kids’ flower hats, and I hear them calling to me, beckoning me to don them. I haven’t succumbed yet, but I think it’s only a matter of time…

TL;DR: Flowered while I showered; got a good hair wash but nothing else.

Edit: A general idea of what my flower hat looked like in college.

My son was just born and everything immediately changed

My wife woke up in labor about 24 hours ago. I was cracking jokes with her and the nurse for the entire labor process. It didn’t feel real even though it was happening right in front of me. That’s how I was able to stay so lighthearted and chill.

As soon as his head popped out and he was placed on her chest, I went completely silent and started crying. My emotions completely overwhelmed me. I still feel it. There are absolutely no words to describe it. I’m completely lost for words. It’s like a spiritual awakening (I’m not spiritual at all).

I wasn’t keen on having a baby at first. Now that he’s here, I already love him so much.

Welcome to the world, son. I promise to protect and love you.
