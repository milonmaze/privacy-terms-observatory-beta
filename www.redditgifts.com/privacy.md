Why is everyone so okay with working 40-60 hours per week to barely afford life?
Culture & Society

And by afford life, I don‚Äôt mean anything more than simply to continue existing. No extras. Honestly I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm only 24. Gen z has had the housing market door shut on us. We can barely afford to rent with roommates let alone by ourselves. Food and gas eat the rest of our income.

What the actual fuck

Put my 2 week notice in yesterday and my manager says ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre just in it for the money?‚Äù

Yes. Yes I am. I need more money to house and feed my family. You haven‚Äôt given it to me, so I found it elsewhere.

I‚Äôve been at my company for 4 years and if somebody else is gonna come in and pay me a lot more to do another job. I‚Äôm gonna take it. I‚Äôm not here because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family‚Äù or because ‚ÄúI LOVE SaaS platforms and it‚Äôs always been my dream to work at one.‚Äù Lol.

Fuck you pay me.
