Rule 4 is officially suspended
Rule Update

Since the sub came out we've upheld a rule against discussion of private servers and cheats etc on the basis of a good faith that Blizzard would be running Classic to a certain standard.

The standard has been pretty fucking low for a very long time but it's clear today that the mask of integrity has totally fallen from the face of greed.

As such feel free to discuss other options to play all versions of Classic in a way that has a higher integrity than what Blizzard has to offer.

Any bans for Rule 4 will be overturned on appeal.
