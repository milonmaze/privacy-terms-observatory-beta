I’m currently living like my husband does

UPDATE: Holy shit, I was not expecting my post to get so much attention, especially since there are probably dozens of similar posts in here every single day. I stopped reading and responding after a few hours to avoid getting too riled up, but I do appreciate the support.

So here’s how it went.

“Are we eating dinner tonight?” “I don’t know, are you cooking dinner?” “Uhh okay wow” shakes head in disapproval “Well, I figured since you said you do everything around here, I could just chill and you’d take care of it like you always do.”

Then a short back and forth, I didn’t say that, yes you did, etc etc.

He got up, made himself a sandwich, and had dinner at his computer. A little while later I made myself some food and ate in peace in the living room. I finished my dinner, put my plate on the counter and left it there with the rest of the stuff. A couple hours later he came in the bedroom and announced he ran the dishwasher because the dirty dishes stunk (normally I would have run it last night and it was now almost 24 hours later - ewww david). He asked if I was boycotting that, too. “Well, like I said, since you do everything around here, I figured you had it under control.” He left all the non dishwasher stuff on the counter. He said I was brutal, I said yep I sure am. I went about my skincare routine and went to bed a little after him. He leaned over to drink some water and guess what, no water! In the 16 years we’ve lived together, he hasn’t done that particular “chore” ONCE. I told him that shit doesn’t just happen by magic and turned off the light.

I fucking hate being this petty and I don’t really like myself very much right now. I finally opened up to a friend this afternoon; she has been through a divorce and had some good advice. I think my next step is to get an appt with a therapist, get my head on straight and figure out my next next step.

I’m working 9 to 7 tomorrow, I wonder what will be waiting for me when I get home. ———

ORIGINAL POST: Yesterday we had a huge fight about household chores. Yep, another post about one person carrying the household on their back and the other just living their best life but still somehow complaining they have to do everything.

My husband helps with laundry every Saturday and empties the dishwasher AT BEST once a week. That’s it. Last night he got pissed while he was drinking and decided to go clean his toilet and bathroom floor at like 10 at night with the “woe is me I can’t believe I had to do this” atitude and he kept arguing with me from the bathroom. I told him that just because he cleans his pissy bathroom once every three months that doesn’t make him fucking Cinderella.

I feel kind of childish but him saying that he has to do everything around the house got me seeing red. I went to bed without washing the dishes or clearing the kitchen at all. This morning I woke up, got my breakfast, did not touch the dishes. Got my coffee and sat in front of my computer, caught up on my shows and played my games. When I was done eating breakfast, I took my dishes in the kitchen (was feeling generous) and I just put them on the counter and left them there. I’m not going to do those dishes and I’m not cooking dinner. I’m just gonna do what he does every single day, do whatever I feel like doing and then either ask what’s for dinner or just show up to dinner when it’s time. Of course there will be no dinner, but still.

We have sat down and had conversations about this several times. “I bet my father never had to clean the bathroom” is the kind of response I usually get from him.

I thought about making a new account to post this with but then I thought, fuck that, I have nothing to be embarrassed about. I am a grown ass person, and I did nothing wrong.

Except maybe not standing my ground sooner. This is such bullshit.

The PGA Tour is dead to me.
Professional Tours

If this merger goes through, which it appears it will, I am personally done with the PGA Tour. The unbelievable hypocrisy of the board would be bad enough, but the fact that they are selling out to a foreign entity linked to a government that has funded terrorism around the globe and perpetrated one of the most heinous terrorist attacks in history is unforgivable.
