As a non-smoker, does every smoker smell bad to you?

I've been smoking cigarettes daily almost 10 years now, at least a pack a day, more in the weekdays. It is the norm for me, I haven't felt the smell of cigarettes on someone in a very long time, but I remember it from childhood and it was disgusting. I don't smoke inside and noone has mentioned it so far. I also have a very good hygiene and overall state. I'm curious what you, non-smokers say about this
