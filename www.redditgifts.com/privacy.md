People attracted to men, what do you find attractive about men that most men are insecure about?

Yesterday I saw a wholesome post asking what men found attractive about women that women are insecure about and as a woman the comments section made me happy so I wanna redirect the question to anyone attracted to men: what do you find attractive that men seem to be insecure about? I'll go first, a man moaning. Hottest sound in the world

AITA for suggesting my wife lower her standards so that she'll be less overwhelmed?

My wife (37f) and I (38m) have 3 kids, 12, 10, and 8. She is in a constant state of overwhelm and very easily irritated, constantly complaining how it's all too much. I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high.

She insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves.

Also she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work!

I'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?

Why do males take so long to poo?

All males I have dated, would come home after work and spend at least 30mins to 1 hour to poo and this would be almost daily. My ex even had a name for it. He has to go and "dominate", like what?

Anyway why does males take so much longer than females?

ETA: Male and Females to Men and Women I honestly wasn't thinking about the difference and didn't realise the terms would be offensive?

AITA for refusing to marry my high school sweetheart?

My partner (28M) and I (29F) have been together for 12 years. We met when we were next-door neighbors as children and started dating at 16. We made it through high school, then college, and now we live together. We've both had conversations about marriage, and we agreed on it not being a priority as we're content with our lives right now. That was until I fell pregnant. I'm currently 33 weeks along, and my boyfriend proposed to me a week after we found out.

While I appreciate my partner's intention of wanting to do the right thing, I strongly believe that getting married solely because of the pregnancy is not a solid foundation for a lifelong commitment. My parents married only because they were about to have me, and it ended terribly. Marriage should be a thoughtful decision based on love, mutual respect, and shared aspirations, rather than a knee-jerk reaction to unexpected circumstances.

He doesn't see it that way and has been pestering me about getting married throughout my pregnancy. He says now that it's his priority to get married before our baby is born because he wants our child to grow up in a traditional household. My partner has never been the conservative type and has been very liberal in his views, alongside coming from a liberal family. So, this confused and frustrated me a lot. We've gotten into big arguments over this topic.

And now, I'm beginning to feel as though I should just say yes to minimize this constant tension and stress..

My sister is getting married, and this is the group text we received regarding our kids

I(m) have 3 sisters. The first two, Lisa and Maggie, both have kids, and the youngest is the one getting married. At the time of the wedding, lisa's kids will 14, 11, and 8. Maggie's kids will be 9, 5, and 1.5, and mine will be 17, 14, 3.5, and 1.5. Both Maggie and I live in a different state, and will be traveling 1200+ miles to the wedding, Airbnb a house, renting cars.... ultimately spending quite a bit of money. There was early talk about how there weren't kids at the wedding, but immediate family would be ok. Bachelorette and bachelor parties are in Mexico and AZ respectively. My wife and I, as well as my 2 other sisters are in the wedding

We recently received this text:

Hey guys! I just want to make sure we are all aligned on my wedding and the festivities… since we are 9 months out I want to make sure you have adequate time to arrange plans

No babies/children allowed at the bachelorette/ bachelor party

No babies/ children allowed while we are getting ready - we need them to be watched during the day until family photos are scheduled. And even then you need someone to hold and help while photos are being done (Mom and dad will not be able to help)

babies / children allow after dinner and a small part of the reception- then they need to go to the house next door.

No MOH holding babies during the reception dinner as you will be making speeches

No holding babies during the ceremony and we need to figure out who is holding the kids during the ceremony. Mom and Dad are not going to be able to help hold the kids at all through the day.. We have the house next door and the children can go there and we will help find a baby sitter for the night. I really want to make sure we have a chance to celebrate and we are not worrying about the kids. It is important to us that y’all are there and having a great time at our wedding. We are excited celebrate with y’all and have a stress free night!

This text was specifically about Maggie and me (the two 1.5yo, 3.5yo, and 5yo are not ok to attend...we had to ask which kids specifically weren't allowed), but was sent to everyone. Maggie nurses, may continue to do so, and the 5 year old is good. My wife nurses, may continue, and my then 3.5yo has type 1 diabetes.

So we are at a point where we go to the wedding, and stress about the babies. How's his blood sugar...he's low..is he getting a snack? He's high, is he getting a correction dose? If nursing, my wife won't be drinking. I also won't drink because we have to wake up to any alarms for high or low blood sugars. If it were an hour, ok...but it's looking like an all day thing.

The other side is we decline to go. If it were anyone else we wouldn't deal with the hassle and politely decline the invite. This would create a mess with the family. Maybe we just decline the bachelor and bachelorette trips...or ask to be taken out of the wedding party.

So, we take time off work, and spend thousands for a trip that we are ultimately going to be dreading. We won't enjoy the day/evening because we will be concerned for the babies, esp the 3.5yo and his care, and we're told it'll be a stress free night. Is this how others would feel? I really don't want to pay for a headache.
