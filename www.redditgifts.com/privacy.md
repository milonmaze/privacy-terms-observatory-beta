Any “you missed the point” movies?

Here’s the explanation: Several months ago I showed my fiancé “tropic thunder”. She was extremely skeptical of the movie’s quality, specifically because of the RDJ “blackface” character. She thought it was ridiculous that a studio company could get away with something like that in the 21st century, but it wasn’t until she sat down and watched it that she realized “huh, that was a good movie that I got totally wrong!”

I’m curious if there are any other movies that people saw that had similar thoughts on. Where, be it for either trailers, screenshots, or media stories, the viewers “missed the point” on a movie simply because they didn’t watch it.

Japan should be just as vilified as Germany is today for their brutality in World War 2

I'm an Asian guy. I find it very shocking how little non-Asian people know about the Asian front of World War 2. Most people know Pearl Harbor and that's pretty much it. If anything, I have met many people (especially bleeding heart compassionate coastal elites and hipsters) who think Japan was the victim, mostly due to the Atomic Bomb.

I agree the Atomic bomb was a terrible thing, even if it was deemed a "lesser of two evils" approach it is still a great evil to murder hundreds of thousands of civilians. But if we are to be critical of the A-bomb, we also need to be critical of Japan's reign of terror, where they murdered and raped their way across Asia unchecked until they lost the war.

More people need to know about the Rape of Nanking. The Korean comfort women. The Bataan death march. The horrible treatment of captured Allied POWs. Before you whataboutism me, it also isn't just a "okay it's war bad things happen," the extent of their cruelty was extraordinary high even by wartime standards. Google all those events I mentioned, just please do not look at images and please do not do so before eating.

Also, America really was the driving force for pushing Japan back to their island and winning the pacific front. As opposed to Europe where it really was a group effort alongside the UK, Canada, USSR and Polish and French resistance forces. I am truly shocked at how the Japanese side of the war is almost forgotten in the US.

Today, many people cannot think of Germany without thinking of their dark past. But often times when people think of Japan they think of a beautiful minimalist culture, quiet strolls in a cherry blossom garden, anime, sushi, etc, their view of Japanese culture is overwhelmingly positive. To that I say, that's great! There is lots to like about Japanese culture and, as I speak Japanese myself, I totally get admiring the place. But the fact that their war crimes are completely swept under the rug is wrong and this image of Japan as only a peaceful place and nothing else is not right. It comes from ignorance and poor education and an over emphasis on Europe.

Edit: Wow I did NOT expect this to blow up the way it did. I hope some of you learned something and for those of you who agreed, I'm glad we share the same point of view! Also I made a minor edit as I forgot to mention the USSR as part of the "group effort" to take down Germany. Not that I didn't know their huge sacrifice but I wrote this during my lunch break so just forgot to write them when in a rush.
