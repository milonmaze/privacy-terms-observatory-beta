Parent came in to observe my class to see why their child is failing and the kid didn't know.

I have a student that is failing. All she does all day in class is sleep, try to get on her phone, and ask to go to the restroom, nurse, or counselor for long periods of time. During my class, I get a knock on the door from someone in the office, and they ask to speak with me outside. I go out and see a woman who is the aforementioned student's mother.

She came to observe her child in classes to see why she is failing. She tried talking to her daughter but all she told her was that the teachers don't know how to teach and that she doesn't understand them; that she turned in all of her work and her teachers haven't graded them yet. The usual excuses. The mother wanted to see for herself what was going on before she made her judgement, but told me she "doubts that all teachers don't know how to teach" and already knows her daughter "talks out of her ass". She asked what her daughter was doing now and I showed her that she was sleeping in class. The mother asked if she could go wake her up and I allowed it.

The mother walked to the front of the classroom, tapped at her daughter's desk to wake her up, and proceeded to chew her out for a few minutes. I must admit, the look on that poor girl's face waking up to see her pissed off mother in the classroom was priceless. She didn't yell but everyone was quiet when she started talking so everything could be heard, then walked to the back of the room to sit and observe the rest of the lesson.

I taught my lesson as usual and then met with the mother after class, who liked that my way of teaching was approachable as well as the opportunities to pass that I provided the kids even though math may not be their best subject. I spoke with the mother about what she needed to pass along with my email to contact me whenever she wanted an update.

I think more parents should do surprise visits like this to see what their kid is actually doing in class when they think their parent is not looking. I know I shouldn't be too happy about this, but I found the situation hilarious even though I feel a little bad how embarrassed the girl must feel having her mother escort her straight to her classes in high school and watch her flounder through lessons she never paid attention to. I do hope this results in a positive change in her behavior and work ethic for the rest of the year.

Bacon does not belong on burgers

Basicslly jsut the title, I have never understood why you would want to put bacon on a burger. The last thing a burger needs is more grease and if you have a really good burger, it needs very little to accompany it. Even if it's a bad burger, adding bacon to it doesn't improve it, it just masks the bad burger, so just eat a BLT and forget your bad burger. Having meat to accompany your meat is gross and unnecessary.
