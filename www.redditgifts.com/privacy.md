You want me to coerce an inspector after someone else did the work?
MOC

This happened years ago. I had just started working as an independent electrician, and one day I received a call from a new customer. He was one of those people that flips homes in lower income neighborhoods. I‚Äôll call him Todd, but honestly, I‚Äôve forgotten what his name is. Todd asked me to meet him at a vacant house he recently bought to give him an estimate for a full rewiring job. He was 30 minutes late, so I was already unimpressed with him.

Upon entering the house, which was right after a rain storm had passed through, we found an inch of water covering the hardwood floors. There was water pouring out of small holes in the columns on the front porch. Everything was soaked. Instead of showing me around, Todd called his business partner and brother and spent the next 20 minutes cussing him for not fixing the roof.

I‚Äôm standing around and listening to his man-baby rage on full display. The whole time I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to work for this guy. His fuse was way too short and his anger was out of hand. I gave him a price, which admittedly was the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this job price‚Äù, and didn‚Äôt hear back from him. Until months later‚Ä¶

Todd called me later that year. He explained that he had found an electrician from three states away, and had paid the electrician with ceramic tiles instead of cash. The problem now? Well, he needed an inspection from the city electrical inspector. I agreed to meet the inspector for him, which I would bill him for.

I went back to the house about twenty minutes before the inspector showed up and saw numerous issues. When the inspector arrived, we walked through together. Every issue I saw, the inspector also saw. He pointed them out, and every time, I agreed with him that the work was not up to code. This inspector kept looking at me with a puzzled expression. After we did a complete walk through I finally explained to the inspector that I didn‚Äôt do any of the work and was hired to get him to pass the inspection. He asked me if I thought he should and I told him ‚Äúabsolutely not‚Äù. I got paid for my time, I got paid to repair all the violations, and I formed a strong relationship with that inspector, who was always lenient with me on all my future jobs.
