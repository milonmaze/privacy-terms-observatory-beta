Anthony Borges was 15 when he shielded twenty students from the Parkland shooter by blocking a classroom door almost 5 years ago (Feb 14, 2018). Taking several bullets himself and surviving while securing the door, he was dubbed "the real Iron Man".

LPT: In most cases you don't need to wash your clothes with hot water. Heating the water takes up almost 90% of the energy expenditure of a washing machine. Most detergents nowadays don't even need high temperatures and work fine in the cold. It's better for your wallet and the environment.
