[Rapoport] Sources: Former No. 2 overall pick #Commanders DE Chase Young is being traded to the #49ers. Incredible. Likely a mid-round pick in 2024. After dealing Montez Sweat to the #Bears, Washington now trades Young to one of the NFL‚Äôs best.

I refuse to stay for my child, AITAH ?

I never wanted to be a father. I'm the oldest of six kids and most of my childhood and teen years were spent being a third parent to my younger siblings.

My ex girlfriend knew this from the start of our relationship in 2017. She said she was fine with it. Then at some point during the pandemic she got severe baby fever which she admitted probably happened because both her sister and best friend had their babies between late 2020 and mid 2021. She said she didn't think she wanted to be a mom until then and her mind couldn't change back. I told her no but if this was something she felt strongly about we could break up and she could find a man who wants to be a father.

We went on a break for a few months before she asked me to get back together. She said she had time to think and while still wanted to be a mom, would try to just be cool being an aunty. Then we move to mid 22 where she tells me she's pregnant, it's mine and she's not getting an abortion. I asked how and she admitted she'd been off her BC for some time. I was furious. She had our baby earlier this year and I just can't do it. I never wanted to be a dad. She knew this six years ago. I get that her mind changed but then she said she'd be chill about having a baby so I thought we would genuinely move past that. I expected it to come up again but not a pregnancy.

I've told her I'm leaving. I make good money and will pay child support. But I never wanted this. She didn't at first then she did then she went and did all of this to me. So now I'm looking like a massive A-Hole to everyone from friends to family to random people we're loosely acquainted with because I'm the dad who's ditching his child.

AITAH?

Edit: I have not been replying due to work and commuting home. For all the why not a vasectomy questions: here's the thing, I like kids. I had great experiences with my siblings when I was young and with my younger cousins. So despite not wanting to be a dad, I did hold out on the off chance that one day something might change, I'd put my past behind me. It was a 'For the 1% - 5% chance I start wanting to have a child' choice. Essentially I never wanted to be a dad but like my gf's mind changed, I was always aware of the possibility that my mind could change at some point. People are complicated sometimes.

Any movies where the "bad guy" is revealed to be the "good guy"?

So there's plenty of movies that lead the audience to believe a character is in the right, or helps the protagonist, or is the protagonist, only to reveal at the end that they had an ulterior motive or evil plan or betrayal in mind.

But what about the opposite? What films make the audience root against a character and then show us that they were right the whole time?

Spoilers allowed, I'm just looking for something that fits this theme.

Edit: Would you guys agree with me that Mr. Nevercracker from Monster House counts? Yay or nay?

Edit 2: Loving the discussion here guys, so many movies to watch now, thanks! I do have to say that I'm seeing some popular answers like Star Wars (Vader) and Megamind, however those don't really fit what I'm asking for. I said characters that "were right the whole time". Megamind wasn't right until the last 20 minutes and Vader spent a grand total of 90 seconds being right.
