Who is a Nepotism kid with actual talent?
Discussion

A lot of people put a stigma around nepotism kids in Hollywood like Scott Eastwood, Lily Rose Depp etc (for good reason) but what’s an example of someone who is a product of nepotism who is actually genuinely talented and didn’t just try to coast on their parents/ relatives name?

Dakota Johnson in my opinion is talented in her own right and didn’t just try to coast on her father’s (Don Johnson’s) name.
