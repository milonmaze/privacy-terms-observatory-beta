AITAH for telling my girlfriend she's wrong about my family after she met them for Thanksgiving?

I invited my (29M) girlfriend (27F) to my family's Thanksgiving dinner. My mom, my aunt and my sister-in-law's are all the best cooks so they always take care of dinner and everything. My mom was so excited to meet my girlfriend that she [my mom] pulled my girlfriend in the kitchen to help. Everyone liked my girlfriend and I thought it was a good day but my girlfriend is mad at me now.

She got mad that all the women did the cooking and cleaning up while the men sat around and did "nothing". She asked me why I didn't try to help. My mom or any of my relatives never asked and I don't want to be in the way. It's nothing to do with women or men. The best cooks in the family make the dinner. It just so happens to be women who do it. My girlfriend said she got pulled into cooking too and she didn't want to be rude to my mom so she said yes. It's because my mom was excited to get to know her but my girlfriend said my brother brought his new boyfriend to meet the family and he didn't pulled into helping. According to her my mom waited on him hand and foot but my girlfriend got put to work. She's also mad at me because she kept coming out to see me and she was trying to get me to get her out of the kitchen but I kept "sending her back". I had no idea she wanted out and didn't want to help my mom and everyone.

AITAH for telling her she's wrong when she basically made it out that my family treats men and women differently? My mom is a lawyer. My sister-in-law is an biologist. All of the women in my family are educated and have careers. Women are not treated differently or as "less than". They just happen to be the best with cooking. My girlfriend won't talk to me or return my messages. She's overreacting right? I can't see why she's mad like she is.

What exactly are we paying taxes for in the US?

-no health care

-no infrastructure

-no free education

-no free job prospects (in most countries you don't start paying off your loan till they place you with a proper job)

-no family benefits

-no childcare

-no public transit

-no safety net

-no mental help

so what is the 17 trillion GDP that just went up by 5% last fiscal quarter paying for exactly

people say we don't wanna increase our taxes 1% to pay for universal healthcare.. but THEY ARE INCREASED way more than 1% and I have no idea for what

Is it true that most men get no compliments?

I mean I think it is true that they receive way less than women, but they gotta overexaggrate right? Like all the guys saying the last time they were complimented being years ago. Even though I'd consider myself a below average looking guy it isn't THAT uncommon.

TIL James Earl Jones was officially replaced as the voice of Darth Vader last year by AI with Jones' consent. The move was made after he told Disney that he "was looking into winding down this particular character." He consented to the future use of his voice with AI to "keep Vader alive."
