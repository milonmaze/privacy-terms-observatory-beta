Mom thinks a crowded plane is her living room

We just got off a cross-country night flight. When we boarded (2 adults, 1 child) we noticed that there was a woman with four kids behind us. She was in a row with the two youngest and the two (slightly older), who were maybe 5 and 7, were directly behind us. Almost immediately she hands them tablets and they start blaring kids TV shows. I decide to get ahead of it so I asked if she had headphones for the kids. She said no with a ‚Äúwhat are you going to do?‚Äù shrug. My partner calls the flight attendant and asks if politely if they have headphones to borrow or for sale. She asks what kind of plug he needs and he lets her know it‚Äôs for the kids behind us. Then the mom gets all huffy saying ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need headphones! They are just complaining about my kids!‚Äù No lady. We are not complaining about your kids. We are complaining about YOU and the fact that you are letting your kids watch TV like they are in their living room, not on a packed fucking plane full of other humans.

What's one of the biggest wastes of money in Gaming

I was in GameStop the other day to put a pre-order down on Super Mario Wonder and the dude asked me if I wanted to put a warranty down on it. Like, put a potential damages warranty down for my Switch cartridge. My small, plastic rectangle that won't even take damage from being dropped.

What? Why would anybody pay money for a warranty on a Switch cartridge? To cover the damage if the poison taste goes away? It made me curious what other rip-offs there are in the gaming world that I haven't thought of!

AITAH for Asking my Husband for a Semen Analysis Before we got Married?

My husband and I have been married for 10 years, together for 2 years before that so this came as a bit of a surprise when he recently brought it up.

We were in the middle of a small argument and he brought up how hurt he had been that I had asked him for a sperm test before we got married.

To clarify my husband had had to undergo chemo therapy for a while before we met (not cancer) and we were told that this could possibly affect his sperms count and our chances to have children.

While I loved him very much (we had been together for around 2 years at that point), I wanted children more than anything. He knew this from the very start. That it was a deal breaker for me not to be able to have children. I constantly suggested we both go get tested but he didn't really care about kids at the time so told me not to bother going. But I still wanted to go together. He ended up going and was told he would be able to have children but it seems like he hasn't forgiven me for asking him.

To clarify I had been asking almost from the start of the relationship when I found out he had done chemo and he was always just brushing me off.

Now we have 2 amazing kids and he loves them SO much.. but maintains that I was wrong to hurt him that way. That my asking him suggested that I didn't love him enough to marry him if he was infertile. Tbh I hadn't thought that far ahead, at the time I just wanted to know what our options were before worrying too much about it.

I also told him that not being able to have children would have made me extremely unhappy in our marriage and that I would have always wondered what if. His response was what if I was the one who wasn't able to have kids? And in my mind I completely understand his point of view and I do feel like I may have been an AH.

So tell me reddit.. WITAH?
(P.S. Please be kind).

Edit/Update:

I have tried to respond to as many comments as I can but am going to have to stop now because it's getting a bit much. I just wanted to clarify a few points that keep popping up in the comments.

1- The comments seem to be mostly that I am TA. Fair, I accept I was the AH in that situation but I really didn't appreciate the vulgar comments. I came to talk and people seem so ready to attack instead of just give an opinion (AH or not). To some of you.. I hope you get the help you need if you feel like being hateful to a random person online makes you feel better about yourselves.

2- I absolutely in no way "forced" him to do that test. He had every right to say no. I asked multiple times over the 2 years (including trying to talk about it... multiple times) and he always brushed me off.. until he didn't. I also complained understand now after talking to him why he brushed it off.

3- My husband absolutely understands why I asked him. Just like I absolutely understand why he feels hurt. I have already apologized and we have talked about it like adults. He harbours 0% resentment towards me and does not think I'm a "disgusting person" üòÉ

4- For everyone who suggested counselling.. we did the healthy thing for our marriage and started counselling early on because we believe all relationships have issues and we wanted to tackle everything head on from the start and learn how to communicate in a healthy way. This is just something he never mentioned before.

5- I am absolutely grateful for everyone who took the time to comment, whether in a constructive way (both AH and NTA) and those who were trying to be hurtful and less constructive. Because it reminded me that we are all people going through our own thing. I am not hurt by these comments because I try to be a better person every day and do the best I can for my family. I wish you all love in your lives.

6- We are not defined by mistakes that we make. For people insulting me.. come on grow up. You have every right to your opinion but calling me disgusting and vulgar and surprised that he would marry me? Someone even suggested that he should have hit me. That one made us both giggle a little because of how unhelpful it was. üòÑ

7- My husband and I come from VERY different cultures. In mine (as I mentioned in one of the comments) we do not have children before marriage (absolutely no judgement to those who do) and we do not get divorced except for infidelityand infertility. That's why I told him we should BOTH get tested and it absolutely would have been 100 percent fair if he had ended the relationship after finding out I couldn't have children and he wanted them. Because we would have wanted different things.

8- My husband did not have cancer. He underwent chemo because his appendix had ruptured and as a result of that they had to surgically clean inside around that area (sorry I don't what that is in English). He had some growth and they decided to shrink it with chemo instead of attempt to remove it surgically for a couple of reasons. And no he did not consider storing his sperm at the time. This was years before we met.

9- Finally.. a lot of people "suggested" that there were "many" other ways to have children. I asked him after many people commented (we've been reading a lot of these together) if he would have considered a sperm donor. Firm no from him, and call me backwards but I do not want to carry another man's child. Where we live adoption is pretty hard and could take many many years if ever. It is an emotionally turbulent experience. And IVF is out of the question both financially and emotionally. I watched a very close friend suffer through 11 years of IVF which never took until it did and they had a severely disabled child.. and to say she, her husband and her marriage suffered would be an understatement. It's easy for some people who have never seen this first hand to think they know what they are talking about.

Thank you everyone for commenting but I will no longer be responding to comments. I have a cake to bake üòâ

What's a work scam that's become so normalized we don't even realize it's a scam anymore?

I'll start, when they start processing your payroll days out from your check but won't actually show you the check until it's paid. Show us the amounts in advance and we can tell you if it's wrong before it's too late!

I can't tell you how many employers have an app that says the hours I should be paid and still screw up and get me late fees on my bills!

AITA for not letting my MIL and FIL help me with the baby after their reaction to me being injured?

I (21f) have a 7 month old son with my boyfriend. My family lives abroad and are coming over to stay and help at Christmas time. For now, my MIL and FIL (60s-Debra and Bob) are helping me with household stuff and the baby. So far, we haven‚Äôt had any real issues and they‚Äôve been a massive help.

About 3 weeks ago, I fell down the stairs. I wasn‚Äôt holding the baby and the baby was safe. However, instead of helping me, Debra and Bob both jumped to comfort the baby who was crying‚Ä¶ and left me at the bottom of the stairs. My legs were fine, but I was wobbly because of shock and asked one of them to help me up. After nearly 10 whole minutes of being ignored, I managed to stand up on my own and hobble through to the living room. I sit down and Debra says ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs happened to you? Are you ok?‚Äô.

I‚Äôll admit, I saw red. I just said 'I fell down the stairs, didn't you hear me calling you for help?' Debra's eyes widened and she said she was too busy fussing over the baby.

After an hour, my arm was swelling up and I was taken to hospital. Luckily, it was nothing serious and recovery time would be quick. After my boyfriend got home and his parents left, I told him I no longer want their help after today's events. I can manage on my own, even though it'll be hard. He was taken aback and said they've done a lot for us. I said I appreciated it all but they ignored me crying and calling them for 10 minutes after I fell down the stairs. They don't care about me, only the baby and I was embarassed I didn't see it sooner.

He called his parents to let them know we won't need their help anymore and his dad said 'is it about today? we really didn't hear her.' My boyfriend just told them they're invited to sunday roast this week and that's all. I could tell he was not happy about my decision but he said he went along with it because I'm the mother.

Fast forward to Sunday and my BIL and SIL are guests as well. SIL has a 3 year old and is totally on my side but BIL is not. He told me to 'be grateful' for his parent's support as they're significantly more well-off than my parents are and paid for many newborn/infant expenses and plan to pay for many more as the baby grows.

Since then, Debra keeps calling asking if we need any help and says she feels awful not seeing 'the both of you' and that she misses the baby.

AITA for not wanting them helping me in my day to day life?

EDIT: Was the baby crying loudly enough that there is a possibility they didn‚Äôt hear you?
No way. The baby stopped crying after 10 seconds and the stairs are like 2 meters from the living room. There is absolutely zero way they couldn't have heard me
1- scream as I fell
2- the general noise of someone falling, including books falling and wall plates breaking
3- me crying and shouting for help
I fell at the top of the stairs and fell all the way down. This wasn't a missed step and a bum shuffle down that hurt my pelvic bone. I fully fell down the stairs and cracked the banister. No way they didn't' hear. The baby also started crying AFTER the initial smack after I hit the ground.
