My neighbor, everyone. He parks like this when his wife isn't home and moves it back when she's back so they can both park on one of the few spots with shade. This has been happening for months already and the administration doesn't do anything about it.

What’s the saddest song you’ve ever heard?
discussion

No matter how many times you hear it always gives you the feels.

Edit: I didn’t expect as many responses as this has generated, and I’ve been working my way through the list. But the only song I will never listen to again is Routine by Steven Wilson. It breaks me in ways I can’t put into words.
