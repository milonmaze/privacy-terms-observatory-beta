How do I tell people that I don‚Äôt drink alcohol at all ever, without being awkward whenever someone urges me to drink it in social gatherings

Well duh, ‚ÄúNo thanks, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for me most of the times.

Those people feel like this person is being shy in front of us and needs someone to urge them a bit and then they‚Äôll drink. Sometimes some people think, ‚ÄúDamn, this person never took a sip? I gotta make it my life‚Äôs mission today to urge as frequently as I can or at least bring up this matter of the person‚Äôs sobriety‚Äù

The real reason is that I have a history of being raised in an alcoholic family and have very traumatic childhood memories because of which I vowed to never touch any alcohol or anything that makes you intoxicated.

Of course, I can‚Äôt tell this reason since it‚Äôll straight up sour the mood since most of the times I‚Äôm an odd one out in social gatherings and everyone becomes curious why I refuse.

So, please help me. Any way I can articulate this so that people don‚Äôt ask more than once and get the hint that this person never drank and neither will?

Edit: Sorry, I should have be more specific. Friends and complete strangers usually stop pestering after I decline when I attend parties. But it‚Äôs those old people, family friends, relatives who put me in such situations during gatherings and any family events that take place. They get the impression that since we‚Äôre close and "this person is one of ours, everyone here has fun with booze" we are allowed to have the liberty to urge this person. And my life is filled with people who like to meddle in other people‚Äôs lives or hunt for more gossip

Edit 2: Thank you so much everyone for your kind hearted suggestions. I really did not expect my question to get popular. Have bookmarked a lot of your comments. I will definitely try using them the next time I get caught in such situation.
