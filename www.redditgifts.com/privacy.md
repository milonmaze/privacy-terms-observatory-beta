AITAH for my response after a guy rejected me?

This guy (23M) joined my (22F) friend group around six months ago. I instantly felt attracted to him as he‚Äôs a very handsome guy and sweet. At the start we got along well and even spent some time without others. I was certain that we‚Äôd start dating soon.

However after a while we began having disagreements. He would accuse me of having a bad attitude, not being nice to people and mistreating others in general (all false).

Fast forward to a couple of days ago. He hadn‚Äôt asked me out yet so I asked him when he would do that. This is the text he sent me:

‚ÄúListen, you‚Äôre beautiful and my type. I thought you were stunning from the moment we met. But a pretty face means nothing when a girl behaves the way you do. Personality is important to me and yours is‚Ä¶.horrible. You treat people like shit and even made [name] cry over something petty. I‚Äôm not even sure if you notice that everyone constantly walks on eggshells around you.

So no, I decided not to ask you out. I‚Äôm physically attracted to you but you‚Äôre not the only attractive girl in the world‚Äù

I found this text really, really hurtful and shocking. After I read it I went over to his place and we started arguing. I ended up crying and throwing some stuff around. At the end there were some broken plates and glasses.

After this incident my entire friend circle labelled me crazy and unhinged (which I‚Äôm not). Am I really the asshole here after that awful text?

there‚Äôs a lot of negativity in here so I want to thank the people sending me supportive DMs üíô

You win a few million dollars in the lottery, but you decide to keep working. What job would you work if money no longer mattered?

I am comfortable at my current job, but I would also love to instead work at a coffee shop or bookshop or plant store. Or get an entry-level job somewhere outside of my area of expertise simply to learn about other industries.
