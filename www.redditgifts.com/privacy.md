Can a former skinhead reach salvation?

Just give it to me straight.

I used to be one. Racist, sexist, homophobic, the works. I was a fucking shithead. So was my father, and his father before him. All that "southern pride" bullshit.

But I changed. At least, I like to think I did. I abandoned my ways, realized I had been brainwashed, went hard left, pulled a fucking my name is earl with the people I hurt, donate to good causes, hell, even fucking protest.

But, well, yet, I still feel like I can never redeem myself. I can never put more positive out that I did negative. I have trouble getting out of bed, or doing anything for myself, after realizing just how bad of a fuckup I was.

It's been.. Years. Almost a decade. But.

Can I be redeemed? Can I ever become a "good" person?
