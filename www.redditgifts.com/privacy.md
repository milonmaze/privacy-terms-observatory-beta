I’m going in for surgery tomorrow. What’s something funny I can say to my surgeon before I’m put under anesthesia?

I need some good material so he remembers me and doesn’t slice me up like a ham

Update: Uh oh. I think this post is getting too much attention. He might be on to us…

Dear Mr MySurgeonForTomorrow,

Please just accept the one you find the funniest out of all these nice Redditors and may it keep your hands steady and not shaking from laughing thinking about it.

Ps: please don’t cut me up like a thanksgiving ham.

Sincerely, Not a ham
