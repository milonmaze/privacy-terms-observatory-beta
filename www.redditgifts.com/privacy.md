Why wasn’t Cheri Oteri’s star brighter?
Discussion

Growing up, I felt like she was the female lead to Will’s male lead. In subsequent years, I’ve certainly realized Molly and Ana were probably stronger, but I don’t know why I haven’t seen Cheri pop up in sitcoms and movies from time to time. I remember her in an episode of Curb, but not much more.

Kansas school board upholds anti-'Satanism' dress code while allowing Christian clothing | They ignored the pleas of a Satanist mother, who urged them to modify their act of discrimination. "It seems that certain board members are more interested in forcing their own personal religious beliefs"

Minion Dematerializer is an inhumane weapon of genocide and should be promptly removed from the game

Imagine being a minion - small, naive, optimistic, and yellow skinned. You’ve been accepted into an rotc program and have a nice scholarship for minion military university. You’re trained by Gru himself so you’re confident in your abilities. Surely, the 24 attack damage you’ve spent years and years grinding for will turn you into a war hero.

Finally one day you’re deployed onto the battlefield. You’re part of the middle platoon, in the 3rd wave. It’s time. Walking with your brethren in kindergarten single file line, you feel grateful to be able to fight alongside the brilliant champions: for example the ionian ninja Akali, dressed up as a 2D anime school girl, donning a miniskirt and thigh highs into the battlefield.

You meet the enemies in lane and you start making work of them with your rapid fire 0.66 attack speed. It’s going well until this “Now You Can See Me”, Gambit lookin ass dude casts some kind of spell and then to your left your comrade has these 3 orbs that circle around him. The orbit gets smaller and smaller until poof, your comrade disintegrates and is blinked from existence. Not only that but it makes the enemy permanently deal more damage to you and your comrades for the rest of the game. It is only a matter of time before it’s your turn…

Minion Dematerializer is a weapon designed specifically to execute minions. It is a weapon of inhumane slaughter. There is no yuumi dematerializer, no gromp dematerializer, no baron dematerializer, etc etc. This is pure discrimination towards minions. Either make genocidal weapons for all the species or make none at all. Equality in genocide on the rift for all. Thank you.
