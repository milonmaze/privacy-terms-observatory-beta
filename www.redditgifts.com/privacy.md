Going to jail in 7 hours, what is something I should do before I go?

It's only a month but I feel like there's something I'm not remembering. I've unplugged appliances and such, done my laundry, cleaned up, took the trash out, made sure my bills are good until I'm out, no food thats gonna expire while im gone. Is there anything simple I may have forgotten?

Patch 1.1 is essentially a slowdown to every single part of the game.
Opinion

All classes are nerfed.

No reduction in enchantment costs.

Helltides are slower.

Boosting is nerfed to the absolute ground.

Doing content other than Nightmare dungeons is nerfed.

Experience bonus for killing monsters of higher levels nerfed by around 90%

Crit and vulnerable damage nerfed 17% and 40% respectively, not counting the nerf to the inherent affixes to certain weapons.

It is not like this game was lightning fast to begin with, but now it is a proper slog.

Further Update: Husband accused me of financial infidelity

Hi All...so I have an additional (and probably not very surprising) update to my saga.

First post was here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/14pynpt/aitah_husband_accused_me_of_financial_infidelity/ (husband was furious that I spent $5K on a gaming computer, desk and chair even though we are high income earners in a great financial position and I used my own allotment of "fun money" within our established rules)

Second post was here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/14x9o69/update_husband_accused_me_of_financial_infidelity/ (husband told me he was actually upset that he feels I'm not professionally ambitious enough because I'm not on the "executive" track like he is, and that (despite my working full-time) he wanted me to cook fancier meals, set the table in a more elegant way, and dress up more for dinner - yes, like a 1950s housewife)

So, the more I thought about it, the more his requests - demands, really - were sitting poorly with me. I decided to try a little experiment over the weekend to see what would happen if I tried to meet some of his demands. NOT because I actually thought they were reasonable, but because I increasingly had the sense that the goalposts would just keep moving and that I was playing a losing game. So, Saturday morning, I went to the salon for a glow-up (haircut, fresh highlights, mani/pedi) then went to the farmer's market to pick up fresh flowers for our table and assorted other gourmet ingredients. Saturday is usually our date night out but I suggested we stay in so I could make us a special dinner, steakhouse style (lobster bisque, bread basket with several types of rolls/savory muffins made from scratch, crab-stuffed mushrooms, filet mignon, au gratin potatoes, white chocolate mousse topped with raspberries). I wore a lavender (his favorite color on me) sheath dress and high heels and fully done hair and makeup. For all that I got a lukewarm "thanks, it was tasty" and a kiss on the cheek. Of course I did all the serving and cleanup.

Sunday we usually go out but he suggested I make us brunch at home. So I made French-press coffee, mimosas with fresh-squeezed orange juice, Belgian waffles with a bananas Foster topping, eggs scrambled with parmesan and fresh herbs from our garden, roasted fingerling potatoes, and maple-glazed bacon. I wore a blue sleeveless sundress, wedge sandals, again did my hair and makeup. Again I got a "thanks, it's good" and no help with serving or cleanup.

Afterwards I asked if this is what he had in mind when he critiqued me before. He said that it was a start, but that I was "acting very entitled for wanting credit for basic adulting."

He then dropped a bomb that he was being so hard on me because he had realized lately I had a lot to make up for due to my being a "low-value woman." I asked what on earth he meant by that and he said it was because I wasn't a virgin when we met.

WHAT?!?!

Keep in mind we started dating at 21, neither of us claimed to be virgins or stated that as an expectation. Except for very religious people (neither of us is) I don't think most 21-year-old college students are virgins. I was upfront with him then that I'd had two previous partners, my high school boyfriend (we went our separate ways when we went to different colleges in different parts of the country) and another boyfriend I'd had my first year of college. And that's it, both committed relationships and nothing casual.

He then went on to say that because of my low value, I was going to need to be making it up to him for the rest of my life. That I didn't deserve monogamy or equal treatment and that I was lucky that anyone at all wanted to marry me. And - that he's "connected" with someone from work so if I wanted to keep him I'd better step up.

I told him it didn't sound like there was anything to keep if he no longer loved me (or even liked or respected me). Told him to leave and he said he would gladly go to his girlfriend's place.

I know SO many people here insisted he was having an affair and I just didn't want to see it, that his "complaints" were really all part of a campaign to distance himself from me. I feel SO foolish for just thinking he was going through a stressful time at work or that he genuinely wanted to work on our marriage.

Anyway I have taken the week off from work to get my head together. Have an appointment with a lawyer tomorrow. Canceled the marriage counseling appointment but got a referral to an individual therapist who can do an intake session with me later in the week. He (and the girlfriend apparently) are coming this evening to get more of his clothes and things so I have to brace myself for that.

Also, please be assured I do NOT think I am low-value in any way. I let my husband make me think less of myself on some levels for a short time but now I truly see it was a "him" problem. Obviously we don't share the same goals and values and he has become someone I don't recognize.

I know the divorce won't be fun or easy, but I will be okay. Thank you all for helping me see that I was being played before I wasted too much more time in a marriage that was already over.

What is the funniest thing you‚Äôve heard an inexperienced traveller say?
Question

Disclaimer, we are NOT bashing inexperienced travellers! Good vibes only here. But anybody who‚Äôs inexperienced in anything will be unintentionally funny at some point.

My favorite was when I was working in study abroad, and American university students were doing a semester overseas. This one girl said booked her flight to arrive a few days early to Costa Rica so that she could have time to get over the jet lag. She was not going to be leaving her same time zone.
