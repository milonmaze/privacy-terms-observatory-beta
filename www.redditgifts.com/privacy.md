people who live alone and don't want kids or to get married, what are your plans to care for yourself when you're elderly?
Family

Edit: most of the answers seem to be that people don't want to help take care of their parents and don't expect it from their kids either. Given the demographics of people on reddit, is this a cultural thing/difference?
