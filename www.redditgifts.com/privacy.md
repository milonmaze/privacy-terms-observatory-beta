The Witcher 3 is a mediocre game at best

The Witcher 3 was genuinely one of the most boring games I have ever played, I went in with high expectations just because i heard so many people say its one of the greatest games of all time, only to be met with a bland world, slow exploration, sloppy combat, and a find ciri quest on repeat for 30 hours. I swear people are deluding themselves if they think this game is good, it has good graphics (for its time) and a somewhat compelling story, but god damn its so boring to play. I have no idea what people see in this game.

AITA for telling my son I am not buying him new food since he ruined his and he can be hungry for a few hours

It‚Äôs been a long day, I have a son named Jack that is 14. He is a horrible picky eater so getting lunch out on the town is a nightmare most of the time. Now I had all the kids with me to go visit a relative in the hospital, everyone got grabbed out of school for it.

The hospital was a 3 hour drive and we went up this morning. By lunch everyone was starving so we stopped by Chick Fi La. There is a trend of putting the mac and cheese on the sandwich with a sauce. Jack mentioned this and I told him I will not buy him more food if he does it and he doesn‚Äôt like it.

Well he did it and he hated it. Now everything was touching so he couldn‚Äôt just eat the sandwich after taking it off. I didn‚Äôt buy him more food like I said and he didn‚Äôt eat his concoction that he made.

After that we drove back home and he was really hungry. My wife came home and he started telling her how I starved him. We got in argument for not buying him more even though we could afford it.Both of them think I am a huge jerk for this.

AITA should I have just bought more.

He doesn‚Äôt have sensory issue and he is only allergic to cats. We had him tested. If he doesn‚Äôt find the taste up to his liking he won‚Äôt eat it. This includes leftovers, same meal he liked before isnt worth eating as a leftover

Guys this kids has been tested, the school checks for being on the spectrum, he‚Äôs not on it. Yes I know what AFRID is, he doesn‚Äôt have it.
