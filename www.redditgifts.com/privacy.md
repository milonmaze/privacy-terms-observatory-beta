What's the best audience reaction to a movie scene you've witnessed at the cinema?

For me it would have to be when Captain America manages to summon mjolnir in avengers endgame. The theater just erupted. It seems as if everyone was just as invested as the characters of the movie at this point given the amount of movies that had been before it.

When I went to the cinema to see endgame it might be the most phenomenal experience I've ever had at a movie theater.

So whether it was a jump scare that got the entire audience or a comedy scene that made the entire audience laugh I want to hear it.

AITA for cancelling my daughters 13 year old daughters birthday party

Our daughters are 13 and 11

It was my daughters Our daughters 13th birthday was on Friday we had planned a big birthday party at our house about 40 people were invited and a lot of money was spent

Unfortunately my wife got into a car accident when picking up our younger daughter from school the day of her birthday my wife was ok but my 11 year old was seriously injured and had to be rushed into emergency surgery the doctors said there was a risk that something bad could happen

The surgery would last well into the evening and i didn't want to leave her during surgery I told my daughter that I had to cancel her party she was really upset which I understood She stayed with us in the hospital but she was really angry the whole time she said that her sister ruined her birthday and said that she hopes something bad happens to her

The surgery was fine although my 11 year olds condition was still bad but I was extremely surprised that my 13 year old wished harm on her

When she went to meet her sister she said I hope your happy my birthday party got cancelled because of you

I was really angry at her and told her she needed to apologise I get she was upset but wishing harm on her sister and being mean to her was unacceptable

But I have also been feeling really bad as she had been really looking forward to the party and I cancelled it AITA
