I'd like to give my 3080 to someone.

https://preview.redd.it/id-like-to-give-my-3080-to-someone-v0-vs8euslevzxb1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f537c07e2f6b5289d0d9b0142e163c6935d7036

I built a new PC a couple of months ago, and since then my 3080 has been sitting around unused.

I'm not really concerned with money/trying to sell it, but I know someone out there could certainly use it.

So....here I am. Looking to give this beast of a card to someone in need. I'm not looking to give this to someone who wants to upgrade their 3060. I'd really like to see it go to someone who will get a major upgrade out of it.

Comment here what you're currently rocking (maybe some pictures as proof??) and I'll select someone at random by end of day tomorrow.

What are dishwashers like? We only hear them in stories...

As a Filipino I only learned about the existence of dishwashers through american tv shows, and thought why don't we have that?

Then comes denial where I think maybe americans or western people are disgusting cause there's no way a machine would clean dishes thoroughly,

Then comes anger cause I fucking want one and we don't have it.

Then comes bargaining where I would think I would get out of college and be rich, buy a condo, live alone, and buy that mothafucking dishwasher.

Depression is like 5 minutes ago as I just finished a mountain load of dishes cause we're like a fucking tribe here 3 families always eating together cause of "tradition" and "we're close"

Acceptance is now as I finish writing this that I would never have the convenience of a dishwasher cause that just isn't in my blood.

Anyways how effective are those stupid machines anyway? Dishwasher boy

What did they call the girls high-hair styles in the late 80‚Äôs where you grew up? I graduated in upstate NY in 1990. We called our bangs our ‚Äúbouf‚Äù. Teachers called them ‚Äúmall bangs,‚Äù and my dad called them my ‚Äúrooster-doo.‚Äù
