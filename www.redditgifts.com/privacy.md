What movie did you expect it be ‚Äúmeh‚Äù but turned out to be really good
Discussion

(This post was inspired by another post asking what movie did you expect to be good but was meh)

The movie doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to even be good, it can be a movie that you had low hopes for but completely loved

For me, it has to be Edge of Tomorrow. Yes it has some big actors in Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt but the trailers were so bad. It made it look like a bland action movie that was gonna be super generic. The movie ended up being a complete blast and just great fun.

I put vegetables in all my food to stop my roommate's kid from eating it. Mom threatens LEGAL action

I posted this before in a different sub but I figured it would be appreciated here and I have more things to add




Original post-




I posted this in another forum but received a lot of comments telling me to post it here as well.

I(26f) live in a rented house with a single mother(30f) and her son(6m). I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing. I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's place or working. Our work schedules collide so we really don't interact much but when we do it's fine. No issue there.

I want to start with saying that she clearly struggles financially but I don't think it's an excuse. I don't make lots of money either.

However I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.

Just from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in.

Usually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like "what are you going to do with that?" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said "I like brussel sprouts" and that was it. She said "we need food" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.

I think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food.

Also want to add that the sharing is not the issue. It's expecting to have food there and it's not. So often I'd be working a long day and get home expecting to have a meal's worth of food and it all be gone. Or I wake up in a rush and had my food ready to eat in the morning only to find it gone. So now I have to skip breakfast. If she would simply text sometimes "hey is it okay if we eat *food item*" I would know and know to make other plans. I would stop for food or know I have to whip something up when I get home. Also I think eating the LAST of someone else's food is crazy and rude. If someone makes a big pot of something and you ask for a serving, sure. But if someone made something and there is one serving left and you eat it without permission that is evil as hell.




UPDATE




So I have been steadfast with putting vegetables in everything. I've put vegetables in things I've never even thought of. This has carried on and the mom calls me a jerk but will not verbalize that she is eating my food. She just sees me making a lasagna and adding celery and bellpeppers in the layers of fumes off to the side. The only thing I can't add vegetables to is snacks like chips or if I bake brownies or cookies. However this is easily remedied by putting baked goods in a tupperware and keeping them in my room. Same with chips. As I have previously stated the sharing is not the issue. Recently the kid knocked on my door and asked if he would have a bag of microwave popcorn. I said yes and gave him one. All of this would be way less annoying if she'd just text "hey can I have some of this" and waited for my response before just helping herself.




I do feel for the mom because she clearly struggles with cooking and trying new foods. She is older than me and winces at the thought of biting into anything green. And it is spreading to her kid but it's no excuse. A few days ago I was making taco meat out of ground beef and like usual she was looking without looking. She was off to the side watching my every move but trying her to look normal. I made a dish the day before that involved saut√©ed mushrooms and cut up peppers. So when the meat was almost ready I opened the fridge and she freaked when she saw me holding the mushrooms. She said "(son's name) hates mushrooms!" and I just poured them in the pan and mixed along with the cut up peppers.




This caused her to react in a way I'd never seen from her before. She was yelling and stomping around the kitchen while the kid just watched. Felt bad for the kid to have to see his mom like that. People were worried about her tampering with my food. I don't think she's the kind to do that but if she did I would report that right away. She was flipping out but she didn't snatch my food or knock anything over. She was opening and slamming cabinets and it was all very silly.




Then she started going off about how she is going to get the authorities involved. I just told her "sure" and that she needs to relax. She seemed genuinely upset and stressed and I told her that I understand being a single mom is hard but she needs to use her government assistance more responsibly. She'll come home with cold mac n cheese, sushi, and chicken from the grocery store prepared foods and blow all if it on that. I suggested food pantries and buying ingredients that last a while like potatoes. She said I was being condescending and I always have food to eat.




This is to address the "just make a portion of your food and set it aside for her and the kid." I do NOT make enough money to regularly feed two other people. If every now and then she asked for some of my leftovers, sure. But this is a consistent thing that was happening. It's not simple as giving her leftovers that I "won't eat anyway." If I make a pot of something I expect live off of that for the next few days. If it is eaten then MY money is messed up and I have to go shopping again and budget for more food. Wastes my time and money

My bf broke up with me for ‚Äúlying‚Äù about pooping.

I (27f) was seeing a guy (31m) for about 6 months before we decided to make things ‚Äúofficial‚Äù a month ago. He broke up with me a couple days ago for ‚Äúlying‚Äù about two situations which are so absurd to me‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt wrap my brain around it.

For context, he‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôs having trouble trusting people because of our toxic work environment (yes, we‚Äôre coworkers). We constantly need to be on our feet because our boss is a snake who likes to play psychological games with people. Anyways, he said because of the stress work is putting on him, he‚Äôs finding it difficult to trust people & needs to make sense of situations to believe them.

There were two recent situations that didn‚Äôt make sense to him & caused him to distrust/breakup with me:

A week ago at my friend‚Äôs house, we went into the bathroom together to partake in an activity. I stayed in to pee & he went in immediately after me to pee as well. When he came out, he accused me of pooping in the bathroom right before he went in. I laughed & said I didn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt aaand he a accused me of lying & it turned into a big fight about him not being able to trust me. His reasoning was the bathroom didn‚Äôt smell when he left & it did when he went back in after me. I said maybe I just smell like shit & that was not a logical enough answer for him, but after hashing things out a bit, we got past it.

A few days later, we went on a 3-day trip & had a great time together.

2. When we returned from the trip, he noticed that the toy figures on my bookshelf were knocked over. I told him that I hit the shelf with my bag as I was running around my apartment before our trip because I was late in picking him up. He accused me of lying because it didn‚Äôt make sense to him that all of them could fall down at once based on me running into the shelf - someone must have come into my apartment between the BBQ & our trip and set them that way. Which turned into an accusation of me being into one of my close guy friends & cheating on him between the BBQ & our trip.

I thought our relationship was in a good place, so this breakup came out of nowhere for me. The accusations were about things I‚Äôd consider ‚Äúminor‚Äù(poop + toys) & he couldn‚Äôt accept the truth about either because it didn‚Äôt make sense to him. I‚Äôm not sure what else I could‚Äôve said to help things make sense to him or what could really be going on inside his head‚Ä¶
