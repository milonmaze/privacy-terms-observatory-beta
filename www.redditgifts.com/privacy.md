AITA for kicking my 72 year old MIL out of the house at night, because she threw away my things?

I (36F) live with my husband (41M). I have a decent relationship with my MIL, compared to a lot of the horror stories I hear from friends, she‚Äôs quite sweet and warm. She is, however, a little‚Ä¶ over-controlling? Overprotective? I‚Äôm not sure of the exact word, but she has very strong ideas about things and no sense of boundaries. For example, when she stays at our house she takes over the kitchen completely and insists on cooking all our meals. She cooks wonderfully, but she won‚Äôt let me help her at all, and puts everything away in the wrong places - and then insists that her way is more logical.

She only really comes for holidays, though, and I do like her a lot. So I don‚Äôt mind putting up with these mild annoyances. I‚Äôm currently pregnant with our little girl, who will be born in a few months. This is a miracle - I really didn‚Äôt think it would happen, especially so late, but we got lucky. When my MIL heard, she was super excited and said she would come over to help us get ready for the baby. She offered to stay for the next 6 months or so to help out, because my husband and I both work long hours and it will be hard to handle the baby on top of this. She is also pretty emotionally invested in this, because she truly sees herself as part of our family. She arrived a few days ago and set herself up, then she started with the cleaning.

I like collecting things from garage sales and such. Things like little sculptures and books and baskets, stuff a lot of people would consider utter junk. Our house is definitely overstuffed, but it‚Äôs reasonably tidy and doesn‚Äôt seem like a hoarder‚Äôs house or anything. My MIL, on the other hand, likes everything surgically clean. Yesterday I came home from work to find the house like a war zone, she went through my cabinets and cleared out everything she considered junk, and had apparently made several trips to goodwill before I got home. I was really angry and I asked her why she would ever do this. She said the house has to be tidy for the baby, and that it would be ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù for the baby to be in my cluttered house.

Then she took the next huge bag of stuff and tried to walk out the door. I kind of lost it, and I told her she could get out right now. She was shocked that I was serious, and she said she doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go and it‚Äôs so late. It was about 9:30. I booked her a hotel room and called a taxi.

My husband came home an hour later, and when I told him what happened, he was furious with me. He says I disrespected his mom and was ungrateful for everything she‚Äôs trying to do for us. AITA?

I always hear the phrase "talk to YOUR doctor" Do people actually have there "own" doctor they see regularly?

Obviously I dont mean a personal doctor like rich people, but does anyone actually see the same doctor multiple times?

I usually just go to urgent care when I am sick and need meds to treat it (this was twice this year also its only $20 for me to go) or go to specialists directly through my insurance. I've found primary care doctors to be a waste of time and whenever I do go to one I never see that same one ever again. I have gone to see a couple per year to establish care but always have a bad experience.

I am not light on the medical visits either, I go to some sort of doctor 10-20 times or so per year and probably Should be using a pcp if I had one (for giving out referral and managing care) but do not. I dont need them for referral as I have ppo insurance, I can also order blood tests online and get them filled at the local labcorp. This isn't my preference but the only way I can get things to happen. Relying on pcp would take ages and often they don't even take me seriously.

I do not have a pcp I would call "mine" as in having some sort of relationship established. Rarely do I see the same person twice. I do have my psychiatrist though but we dont talk about my physical health or other problems.

Edit: This post has gotten me like a million notifications so I stopped responding to every comment. Sorry if I dont respond

A few things, no "mommy and daddy" dont need to make my appointments. I've made several appointments to several different primary cares within the last 7 years. Also they live several states away anyway

I am US based, west coast specifically.

I dont go to urgent care that much, only when sick. Its a $20 copay for me and generally a better experience than regular PCPs.

Also, yes I see the typo of "there" in the title

Also again this is the main point:

I do not have a pcp I would call "mine" as in having some sort of relationship established. Or seeing them multiple times.

And I have tried yes. Its a weird thing for some of yall to be so angry and make so many crazy assumptions. Relax, I am not making fun of your doctor.

Edit again: For the non Americans, urgent care is not the same as ER in the US. Basically just a no appointment clinic.

People who had an N64, was the controller really that bad?

So, lately when people talk about the N64 they mention how bad and uncomfortable the controller was. i grew up with an N64 (and still have mine) and i never had any issue with it. So i'm wondering if I just have the right sized hands for it or if's the nickelback effect where people just ape one another. Or maybe it's just that it's coming from people who are younger and are just used to way different controllers and thus find it hard to grasp?
