AITAH for resenting my fianc√© for grieving the death of his ex?

My fianc√© (30M) and I (31F) have been together for nearly three years. We were super excited for our wedding that‚Äôs gonna take place 6 months from now. I had a hard boundary against exes in the relationship and we both agreed that. No pictures, no contact, no stories, nothing.

Prior to meeting me, he was in a serious relationship for about the same time as us. However his ex (29F) one day told him she no longer loves him and they broke up. He was heartbroken and it took him months to heal.

Since his ex was blocked, her mom contacted my fianc√© and told him she had cancer and wanted to meet him one last time. This was a difficult decision considering my boundaries but I felt really sorry this girl was losing her life so young so I supported my fianc√©‚Äôs decision to see her, but on the condition I‚Äôll be in the same room as them. Apparently, she had developed skin cancer and doctor had drawn up a prognosis for her a few months before they broke up. The ex told both of us that she wanted him to lead a happy life with a woman who could share a life with him, and wished us well. That‚Äôs why she lied about not loving him anymore, and that she always loved him all this time. She recently died three weeks ago and my fianc√© is a mess.

I can‚Äôt unsee the way they both held each other‚Äôs hands, and the look of nostalgia and love in his eyes for her, as I was looking on, feeling like an outsider. It‚Äôs so difficult and hurtful to see him cry about another woman who he once loved. I literally can‚Äôt unhear things he said to his mom in the kitchen one day: ‚ÄúI wonder what life could have been like with her, WE could‚Äôve been a happy family of our own. She wanted kids with me and we could‚Äôve named her Rose like she wanted‚Äù

Where does this leave me? Why am I in his life still if he‚Äôd rather be with someone else? I promised myself that I‚Äôll only ever be with a guy for whom I am his one and only and first priority. I saw that in him before but now I don‚Äôt know.

Trust me, I am not a heartless person and I would rather not put myself in any position where I‚Äôll be consider myself a monster. But this feels incredibly complicated and extremely hurtful to feel like a third wheel in my once happy, thriving relationship.

He has been reaching out to me for support and I lent a listening ear and he has been telling me so many stories from his time with her and I didn‚Äôt like one bit of this. My therapist told me while having empathy is important, I shouldn‚Äôt have to lose myself in my relationship even if circumstances are hard.

Two days ago, he received a package in the mail and it was from the ex‚Äôs sister. Apparently it was a photo album from their old times that the ex wanted him to have. My fianc√© held it so gently and teared up little.. and I literally broke down on the floor crying, having a panic attack. I think I almost unloaded all of what I‚Äôve been feeling, the third wheel, the unfairness of the whole situation based on what my boundaries around exes had been, my anger at the ex for inserting herself in our lives for no good reason when both of us were literally so happy with how things were panning out regarding our wedding, questioning where his loyalties lied - and I think I did it in one of the most hurtful ways.

I told him that we need to pause our wedding plans for now and wanted a week or two off to think about our relationship. I am at my sister‚Äôs place and haven‚Äôt been able to sleep or eat properly ever since. It‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôm falling out of love with my fianc√© and he has been calling me and texting me non-stop. I feel so guilty right now. He had suicidal tendencies years ago and I am afraid I might trigger that. He says his ex already died and it‚Äôs gonna break him if I left him too. ‚ÄúIf I left him TOO?‚Äù - emphasis on the ‚Äútoo‚Äù, I‚Äôm just done.

And now I just resent him more and more. AITAH?

TLDR: : I had a boundary against exes in our relationship, but my fianc√©'s ex, who had cancer, wanted to meet him one last time. I agreed on the condition that I would be present. During the meeting, I saw their lingering affection and heard him express regrets about their past. Now I feel like a third wheel and question his loyalty. I've asked for a break from our wedding plans and I'm struggling with my feelings. He's been reaching out, but I'm afraid of triggering his past suicidal tendencies. I'm feeling guilty and unsure about our future. And resentful. AITAH?
