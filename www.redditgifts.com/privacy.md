AITA for messing with the sub to make a point?
YTA reddit

First, to our community: we‚Äôre sorry that it had to come to this. This post explains why we‚Äôve made this decision, so we‚Äôd like to take this as an opportunity to explain why this matters to us so much.

We love reddit. Not the company, but the community that‚Äôs able to exist here. This is a platform that has provided so many meaningful spaces to connect with others. Connecting to share, to entertain, to support, to find belonging. Sometimes to help too. Redditors are capable of doing great things when they come together. Redditors have raised money for countless causes, from r/freefolk raising over $130,000, to the dank charity alliance raising over $25,000 (with reddit support!) and so many more, contributed to the world‚Äôs largest secret santa gift exchange, r/askhistorians held actual historical conferences, and just so much more. To see the positive impact you, the users of this community, have had on people, look no further than updates where those that have posted share that firsthand. This is why we moderate, and why we pour countless volunteer hours into maintaining this space. We know reddit is capable of doing so much more good, which makes the recent failures of the company hurt even worse.

A big part of what makes this possible is the diversity that exists here. It‚Äôs the diverse people and communities on Reddit that make it unique. This means accessibility for everyone, and also the freedom to access and interact with reddit in different ways. There are diverse mod tools that support the diverse communities to customize their subs to do fun and unique things. Several of those tools are unavailable on mobile, unless you‚Äôre using a third party app. Without this diversity, Reddit would feel flat and boring. Or it could look like the comments here where you can‚Äôt meaningfully participate and bots dominate.

Feeling lucky? See if automod thinks you‚Äôre the asshole. Comment ‚ÄúAITA?‚Äù on this post. Nothing more, nothing less. Automod will give you your verdict. Do these answers feel completely unrelated to your concerns? We know how that feels. This is the future of reddit if the underlying issues that lead to these poor decisions aren‚Äôt seriously addressed.

Why did we set the sub restricted rather than private? In both cases no one is able to post, but setting it to private means that anyone that hasn‚Äôt been following this closely won‚Äôt know why. Users already aware and participating in the protest won‚Äôt be using reddit during this period anyway. We thought it best to continue to use our platform to increase visibility of the issues we're facing

What on earth do modern day Nazis actually want?

They can't reasonably be hoping for another Holocaust- type outcome. What do they actually want that actually has a possibility of succeeding?
