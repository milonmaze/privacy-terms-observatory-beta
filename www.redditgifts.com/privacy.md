Russian revanchism runs deeper than Putin – The West should be extremely cautious about welcoming Russians who are now trying to flee Putin’s mobilization order. “These Russians still believe in punishing Ukraine, just not involving the general public.”

Bayonetta's original voice actress was only offered $4000 by Nintendo. Video explanation by herself below
News

To clarify, this is the best offer she could negotiate to reprise her role for Bayonetta 3. If you're wondering about how much that is for this kind of job, it's pretty much a disrespectful offer.




Hellena Taylor, Bayonetta's original voice actress, explained on a 4 part thread on her twitter account why she's not back as Bayonetta. Among other things, she opens up by saying that Platinum only offered her up $4000 USD (presumably, before tax). She's also asking people to instead of spending $60 on the game, go and donate it to charity instead (just putting into text what she's saying here). I'll keep updating. For now, the videos are below

Part 1: https://twitter.com/hellenataylor/status/1581289084718227456




Part 2: https://twitter.com/hellenataylor/status/1581289973210574859




Part 3: https://twitter.com/hellenataylor/status/1581290543619112960




Part 4: https://twitter.com/hellenataylor/status/1581291176073707520




This gold and reddit award thing could be donated to a charity of your choice instead, thank you.
