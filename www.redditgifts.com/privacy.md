What’s a film whose cult status still baffles you?

Mine is The Big Lebowski. Not because it’s not a good movie; on the contrary, I really enjoyed it. But I just don’t think I understand it on the level that many others seem to do. And while I find it entertaining, it still surprises me how popular and fiercely defended it is to this day, with some even claiming it’s the best Cohen brothers movie ever. Am I crazy? What are some of yours?

EDIT: For the record, no, I am not a golfer.
