Is going through your partner’s phone an acceptable practice now?

A few younger folks have told me they do this (I’m in my 40’s), and I see posts about this on reddit all the time, of just going through your boyfriend or girlfriend’s phone looking for evidence of cheating.

This is… horrifying to me? It’s so invasive, but it seems shockingly common.

I work with a number of domestic violence organizations and one of the #1 pieces of advice we give to people is to make sure your partner doesn’t have access to your phone or email because it’s used so often for stalking and abuse.
