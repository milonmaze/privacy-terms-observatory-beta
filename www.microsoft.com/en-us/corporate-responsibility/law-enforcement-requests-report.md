Our reports

The Microsoft mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and all of our technologies are designed to further that mission. We protect the privacy of our customers and work to earn their trust every day. At the same time, Microsoft recognizes that law enforcement plays a critically important role in keeping our customers—and our technology—safe and free from abuse or exploitation. We are hopeful that this report can both inform the public and contribute to the discussion about how best to strike the balance between the privacy of our customers and the legitimate needs of governments to protect and serve their citizens.

Our principles 

While these reports include separate sections for requests based on law enforcement, national security, and civil authorities, Microsoft follows the same principles for responding to all government requests for customer data.  

Microsoft reviews every legal demand to ensure it is valid and complies with applicable laws. A subpoena or its local equivalent is required to request non-content data, and a warrant or its local equivalent is required for content data. 

Microsoft discloses customer data only when legally compelled to do so.  
Microsoft does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to customer data.  
Microsoft does not provide any government with our encryption keys or the ability to break our encryption.
