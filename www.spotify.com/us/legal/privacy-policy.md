1. About this Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify USA Inc. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.

It applies to your use of:

all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
your use of Spotify on any device
the personalization of your user experience. Watch our personalization explainer video to learn more about this
the infrastructure required to provide our services
connection of your Spotify account with another application
both our free or paid streaming options (each a 'Service Option')
other Spotify services which include a link to this Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site

From now on, we'll collectively call these the 'Spotify Service'.

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.

This Policy is not...

the Spotify Terms of Use, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app

Other resources and settings

Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:

Privacy Center: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more on user rights.
Privacy Settings: Control the processing of certain personal data, including tailored advertising.
Notification Settings Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
start a Private session
choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile

On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.

Cookies Policy: Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.
2. Your personal data rights and controls

Privacy laws give certain rights to individuals over their personal data.

Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'.

The table below explains:

your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them

You can also watch our video about Your Privacy Controls.

It’s your right to...	How?


Be informed

	

Be informed of the personal data we process about you and how we process it.

	

We inform you:

through this Policy
through information provided to you as you use the Spotify Service
by answering your specific questions and requests when you contact us



Know/

Access

	

Request to know and access the personal data we process about you.

	

To request a copy of your personal data from Spotify, either:

use the “Download your data” tool in your account Privacy Settings, or
contact us

When you download your data you will receive the information about your data that Spotify has to provide under applicable laws. If you would like more information about how we process your personal data, you can contact us.




Correction

	

Request that we amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete.

	

You can edit your User Data under ‘Edit profile’ in your account or by contacting us.




Deletion

	

Request that we delete certain of your personal data.

For example, you can ask us to delete your personal data:

that we no longer need for the purpose it was collected for
that we process based on the legal basis of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section ‘Object’ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing

There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:

it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotify’s interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account
	

There are several ways you can delete personal data from Spotify:

to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request deletion of your other personal data from Spotify (and thus close your account), follow the steps on our support page. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in Section 3 ‘Personal data we collect about you’
you can also contact us to request erasure or reach out to customer support via our chat bot



Right to Limit

	

Under California law, request that we limit the processing of sensitive personal data if we are using or disclosing it for purposes other than those specified in Section 7027(m) of the CCPA Regulations.

	

Currently, we are not using or disclosing any sensitive personal data for purposes other than those specified in Section 7027(m) of the CCPA Regulations.




Restriction

	

Request that we stop processing all or some of your personal data.

You can do this if:

your personal data is inaccurate
our processing is unlawful
we do not need your information for a specific purpose, or
you object to our processing and we are assessing your objection request. See section ‘Object’ below

You can request that we stop this processing temporarily or permanently.

	

You can exercise your right to restriction by contacting us.




Object

	

Object to us processing your personal data.

You can do this if:

Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interests, or
Spotify is processing your personal data for tailored advertising.
	

To exercise your right to object, you can:

use controls on the Spotify Service to switch off or adjust some features which process your personal data. See the end of this section on how you can control tailored advertising
contact us



Data portability

	

Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service.

You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal bases of consent or performance of contract. However Spotify will try to honor any request to the extent possible.

	

For information about how to exercise the right to portability, see ‘Access’ above.




Not be subject to automated decision making

	

Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.

	

Spotify does not carry out this type of automated decision making in the Spotify Service.




Withdrawal of consent

	

Withdraw your consent to us collecting or using your personal data.

You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent.

	

To withdraw your consent, you can:

adjust the relevant control on Spotify
contact us

Requests, generally

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under any privacy law. To verify a consumer request to know, request to delete, and request to correct, we ask you to provide certain details related to your Spotify account. Please note, if you do not have a Spotify account we will not have enough information about you to verify your identity and respond to your requests, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to re-identify and link you to a prior visit to the Spotify Service where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests.

Household requests

If all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.

Requests made through agents

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney (in accordance with local law), an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Appeals process

If your request is denied you may have the right to appeal the denial in accordance with the instructions provided to you when the denial was made.

Tailored advertising controls

What is tailored advertising?

This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising or cross-context behavioral advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.

How to control tailored advertising:

You can control tailored advertising in your account Privacy Settings under 'Tailored Ads'.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.

If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads in your Privacy Settings, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.

Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes

After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes.

Criteria used to determine the retention periods include:

What is the appropriate retention period to carry out our purpose? Our systems are designed to automatically 'age out' data based on a defined retention period. We choose the retention period based on its legitimate business purpose.
Do we need to keep data to ensure the service that users expect? We keep personal data for an appropriate period to deliver a personalized service to our users over time. We typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account. For example, Your Summer Rewind and the end-of-year Wrapped campaign.
Are users able to update or delete the data themselves? Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses.
Do we need to keep the data to uphold our rules and keep our service safe? We may keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This is:
to help ensure user safety
to protect against harmful content on our platform
to take action with reports of intellectual property infringement

This also helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules.

Is Spotify subject to a legal or contractual obligation to keep or delete the data? Examples include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data kept for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries

Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU

To ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:

Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us or the third party who processes your personal data.
Adequacy Decisions. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you' to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.

We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:

technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on protecting your account

You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.

If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.

It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download.

9. Children

Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:

is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.

10. Changes to this Policy

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
