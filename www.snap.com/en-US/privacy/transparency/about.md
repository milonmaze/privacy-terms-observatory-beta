About Transparency Reporting
July 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024

In our Transparency Report, we disclose data regarding our safety efforts across our platform. Here we provide additional context and insight into our safety principles, policies, and practices, as well as links to various safety and privacy resources.

History of Snap’s Transparency Reporting

Since 2015, we have produced Transparency Reports that provide important insight into the volume and nature of government requests for Snapchatters' account information and other legal notifications.

Since November 2015, our policy has been to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information, with exceptions for cases where we are legally prohibited from doing so, or when we believe exceptional circumstances exist (like child sexual exploitation & abuse or an imminent risk of death or serious bodily injury).

In 2020, we enhanced our Transparency Report to provide insights into the volume and nature of accounts reported on Snapchat for violations of our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. We also included country-level breakdowns, available for all countries in a downloadable CSV. In 2021, we expanded the scope of our transparency reporting to include data about reports of false information, trademark notices and Violative View Rate. In 2022, we provided additional insight into our moderation actions regarding drugs, weapons and suicide & self-harm. 

In 2023, we started publishing additional transparency reports focusing on certain geographies, in line with applicable legal requirements. Our dedicated pages for Australia, California and the European Union complement the information we provide in our global Transparency Report.

In 2024, we updated our global Transparency Report to include additional data and insight regarding our proactive safety efforts.

We continually strive to further enhance our transparency reporting practices, in line with global legal requirements. 

Additional Safety and Privacy Resources

Snap is committed to providing Snapchatters and external stakeholders with helpful resources regarding our approach to safety and privacy, our policies and related tools. These resources are available in our Privacy, Safety & Policy Hub. Below we highlight some of these and additional resources.

Safety Center

Given that Snap is a platform for 13+ users, we believe it is imperative to inform and engage all users on how to help keep the platform safe. With numerous resources, such as our Parent Guide and Community Guidelines, we aim to equip users and their parents with the tools they need to communicate and understand how to stay safe on Snapchat.

Community Guidelines

Our Community Guidelines form the foundation of our safety principles and are intended to inform users about responsible use of Snapchat. We routinely assess our Guidelines as just one way of actively working to help keep Snapchat safe. 

Reporting a safety concern 

While safety teams and advanced AI operate 24/7 to help keep Snapchat safe, we also rely on our users to report concerns. To do so, we offer tools both in-app and online to report content and individuals that violate our policies. 

Here for You

The well-being and safety of our users are paramount to us at Snap. To provide engaging and high-touch resources for our users, we have developed in-app tools like Here for You, which provides proactive in-app support to Snapchatters who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis. 

Privacy Center

At Snap, we make your privacy a priority. We seek to earn your trust every time you use Snapchat, or any of our products—that is why we treat your information differently than most other tech companies. Even though our products are constantly evolving, our privacy principles and strong commitment to user privacy remain unchanged.

Digital Well-Being Index

We remain steadfast in our commitment to assessing and enhancing the digital well-being of Generation Z through the annual Digital Well-Being Index (DWBI). Initiated in 2022, this comprehensive study surveys teens, young adults, and their parents across six countries—Australia, France, Germany, India, the UK, and the US—to gauge online well-being. The DWBI employs the PERNA model, encompassing 20 sentiment statements across five categories: Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Negative Emotion, and Achievement. By consistently conducting this research, Snap aims to provide valuable insights into the online experiences of young people, informing the development of tools and resources that promote a safer and more supportive digital environment. 

Financial Sextortion

We aim to actively combat financial sextortion through proactive detection systems, partnerships with NCMEC’s "Take It Down" initiative, enhanced in-app reporting tools, and educational resources. Offending accounts are swiftly removed and reported to authorities when necessary.

Parent’s Guide

This guide is meant to help parents and caregivers understand how Snapchat works, the key protections we offer for teens, how to use our parental controls, and to answer common questions.

Law Enforcement Guide

This guide provides information for law enforcement officials seeking Snapchat account records (i.e., Snapchat user data) from Snap.

Safety & Impact Blog

Launched in April 2021, our blog aims to serve as a helpful resource for the many stakeholders and advocates who are interested in how we work to support the safety, privacy and wellbeing of our Snapchat community.
